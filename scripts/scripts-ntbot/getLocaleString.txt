 getLocaleString(0)	45 - Greetings, stranger. I'm not surprised  - to see your kind here. Many  - adventurers have traveled this way  - since the recent troubles began. -   - No doubt you've heard about the  - tragedy that befell the town of  - Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the  - Lord of Terror, walks the world again. -   - I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark  - Wanderer did travel this route a few  - weeks ago. He was headed east to the  - mountain pass guarded by the Rogue  - Monastery. -   - Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to  - have trailed in his wake. You see,  - shortly after the Wanderer went  - through, the Monastery's Gates to the  - pass were closed and strange  - creatures began ravaging the  - countryside. -   - Until it's safer outside the camp and the  - gates are re-opened, I'll remain here  - with my caravan. I hope to leave for  - Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell  - over Tristram consumes us all.  If  - you're still alive then, I'll take you  - along. -   - You should talk to Akara, too. She  - seems to be the leader of this camp.  - Maybe she can tell you more. - 
 getLocaleString(1)	45 - Well met, noble Paladin. It's been a  - while since I've seen any of your kind in  - the west. It would be an honor to aid  - you in any way that I can. -   - No doubt you've heard about the  - tragedy that befell the town of  - Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the  - Lord of Terror, walks the world again. -   - I don't know if I believe that, but a Dark  - Wanderer did travel this route a few  - weeks ago. He was headed east to the  - mountain pass guarded by the Rogue  - Monastery. -   - Maybe it's nothing, but evil seems to  - have trailed in his wake. You see,  - shortly after the Wanderer went  - through, the Monastery's Gates to the  - pass were closed and strange  - creatures began ravaging the  - countryside. -   - Until it's safer outside the camp and the  - gates are re-opened, I'll remain here  - with my caravan. I hope to leave for  - Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell  - over Tristram consumes us all.  If  - you're still alive then, I'll take you  - along. -   - You should talk to Akara, too. She  - seems to be the leader of this camp.  - Maybe she can tell you more. - 
 getLocaleString(2)	51 - I've been leading my trade caravan  - across the eastern deserts for more  - than twenty years now. I've been  - attacked by bandits and outlaws more  - times than I can remember. But never  - when a Paladin accompanied me.  -   - Indeed, your Order has saved me from  - losing a small fortune over the years. I  - just hope you can discover what's  - going on around here and get the  - Gates to the East opened up! - 
 getLocaleString(3)	85 - Cain seems to have great wisdom  - regarding the supernatural. I hope I  - never live to be that wise... - 
 getLocaleString(4)	58 - Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She  - sells the few magic items in her  - possession and can even heal your  - wounds. She is very wise and will help  - you if she can. - 
 getLocaleString(5)	66 - The fiery Kashya commands the Rogue  - archers in battle. I've only spoken to  - her a few times, though. I get the  - feeling that she doesn't like outsiders  - very much. - 
 getLocaleString(6)	88 - Charsi seems to be a very sweet girl.  - She's the smith around here and can  - help you by trading weapons and  - armor. - 
 getLocaleString(7)	55 - Gheed is a wandering merchant of  - questionable character who is traveling  - along with my caravan to the East. He  - will buy and sell most anything. -   - He's greedy, but his wares are beyond  - reproach. I would suggest keeping both  - eyes open when you deal with him. - 
 getLocaleString(8)	71 - To the east are lands of great  - mystery... and the Jewel City of the  - Desert, Lut Gholein. - 
 getLocaleString(9)	68 - I'll gladly take you eastward, if you can  - drive the Evil from the Monastery.   - Then, the Rogues may re-open the pass  - through the mountains. - 
 getLocaleString(10)	70 - It's easy to become lost in the  - wilderness on the way to the Citadel.  - After you have come to the Cairn  - Stones, you must remember that the  - path continues through the caves. - 
 getLocaleString(11)	35 - I am Akara, High Priestess of the  - Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I  - welcome you, traveler, to our camp,  - but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor  - shelter within these rickety walls. -   - You see, our ancient Sisterhood has  - fallen under a strange curse. The  - mighty Citadel from which we have  - guarded the gates to the East for  - generations, has been corrupted by the  - evil Demoness, Andariel. -   - I still can't believe it... but she turned  - many of our sister Rogues against us  - and drove us from our ancestral home.  - Now the last defenders of the  - Sisterhood are either dead or scattered  - throughout the wilderness. -   - I implore you, stranger. Please help us.  - Find a way to lift this terrible curse and  - we will pledge our loyalty to you for all  - time. - 
 getLocaleString(12)	34 - Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good  - to see more of your kind at work in the  - world these dark days. In my opinion,  - the world needs more women to fight  - against the great shadow. But I am  - forgetting my manners...  -   - I am Akara, High Priestess of the  - Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I  - welcome you, traveler, to our camp,  - but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor  - shelter within these rickety walls. -   - You see, our ancient Sisterhood has  - fallen under a strange curse. The  - mighty Citadel from which we have  - guarded the gates to the East for  - generations, has been corrupted by the  - evil Demoness, Andariel. -   - I still can't believe it... but she turned  - many of our sister Rogues against us  - and drove us from our ancestral home.  - Now the last defenders of the  - Sisterhood are either dead or scattered  - throughout the wilderness. -   - I implore you, stranger: please help us.  - Find a way to lift this terrible curse and  - we will pledge our loyalty to you for all  - time. - 
 getLocaleString(13)	42 - The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has  - a long and distinguished history. Over  - the generations our Order has become  - a deadly fighting force as well as a  - bastion for women who sought to forge  - their own destiny. -   - Yet beware, young one, the lure of  - power and knowledge can lead to  - disaster. I have seen ambition foul the  - bravest of hearts and recklessness dull  - hard-won wisdom. -   - You would do well to tread lightly upon  - the dark path you have chosen to  - explore. - 
 getLocaleString(14)	49 - I understand that Cain is the last  - descendant of the ancient Horadrim  - and that his knowledge of their lore is  - vast. He could prove to be very useful  - in discerning the nature of our current  - crisis. - 
 getLocaleString(15)	49 - Kashya has always been fiercely loyal,  - but I fear her anger and frustration  - over these recent events will lead her  - into harm's way. She is highly  - protective of the few Rogues remaining  - under her command and will not send  - them into combat unless there is dire  - need. - 
 getLocaleString(16)	46 - Charsi is young and innocent. However,  - I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to  - the prospect of adventure and danger.  - She takes great pride in her work and  - finds comfort in the fact that her  - weapons and armor are helping to end  - this evil plague. - 
 getLocaleString(17)	48 - Though he has only been our guest for  - a short time, I sense that Warriv has  - faced many harrowing trials. Though  - he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil  - has blanketed the land, his only real  - concern is to reach the eastern trading  - ports with his caravan. - 
 getLocaleString(18)	53 - To be honest, I have done my best to  - stay clear of Gheed. He wears  - dishonesty about himself like a cloak  - and seeks only to better his situation  - by preying on the misfortunes of  - others. - 
 getLocaleString(19)	55 - The wilderness is overrun with Evil and  - the minions of Hell have taken our  - rightful home. We must purge all Evil  - from the Monastery and restore order  - to the world. - 
 getLocaleString(20)	53 - I often dream of the day we reclaim our  - own. The Sightless Eye sees through  - the mist of time a great glory ahead,  - but how far ahead the Eye cannot  - discern. - 
 getLocaleString(21)	67 - Our mental discipline is matched only by  - our skill in archery... I only hope these  - are enough to withstand this awful  - trial. - 
 getLocaleString(22)	59 - Beware that you do not suffer the fate  - of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's  - life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul  - is even worse. - 
 getLocaleString(23)	41 - Even though the corrupted ones were  - once of our Order, you need not shy  - from slaying them, for they stand  - between you and Andariel. -   - Perhaps, when the Demon Queen is  - dead, our Sisters will return to life, but  - more likely they will be forever bound  - to their unholy pact. - 
 getLocaleString(24)	56 - Welcome, outlander, to our glorious  - hovel. I know you're here to challenge  - the evil that's driven us from our  - ancestral home. -   - But, know this. Akara may be our  - spiritual leader, but I command the  - Rogues in battle. It will take more than  - just killing a few beasts in the  - wilderness to earn my trust. - 
 getLocaleString(25)	55 - Well, well, I never expected to see an  - Amazon in these lands. You're very  - brave to have come here. Many of my  - fellow Sisters have fallen under some  - dark spell, and if you're not careful you  - may fall prey to it as well. - 
 getLocaleString(26)	60 - When I was very young, Akara told me  - tales of the Amazons' fearlessness in  - battle and of their skills with spears  - and bows. I like to think we Rogues  - have much in common with you  - Amazons. - 
 getLocaleString(27)	64 - Some of my Rogues told me of Deckard  - Cain. They said that he is a man of  - great wisdom. Personally, I don't know  - how wise he could possibly be if he  - never learned how to wage battle  - himself. - 
 getLocaleString(28)	57 - Akara has been like a mother to me for  - as long as I can remember. She is wise  - and good, but I don't think she has the  - steel to retake our Monastery by force. - 
 getLocaleString(29)	89 - I don't trust many outlanders, but  - Warriv seems fine. He never says much  - to me, though. - 
 getLocaleString(30)	66 - Before our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith,  - could fashion any implement of war. -   - Here in the camp, she merely makes do.  - Her best tools remain within the  - Monastery. - 
 getLocaleString(31)	58 - Gheed is a pig. I've been tempted to  - throw him out of the camp many times,  - but Charsi seems to think that he's  - good company. I don't trust the man,  - but if she's comforted by him, then I'll  - desist. - 
 getLocaleString(32)	76 - If we could only find out how Andariel  - has managed to corrupt our Sisters,  - then, perhaps, we could drive out the  - evil clouding their minds. - 
 getLocaleString(33)	68 - In this camp, those of us who have  - remained true to our Order are forced  - to live among common traders and  - farm animals. -   - Welcome to our circle of suffering. - 
 getLocaleString(34)	67 - Perhaps Tristram deserved its fate...  - for letting Evil loose upon the land. I  - only hope we don't suffer the same. - 
 getLocaleString(35)	71 - Some evenings we gather at the bonfire  - to retell epic tales... and try to forget  - about the terrible events that led to  - losing the Monastery. - 
 getLocaleString(36)	47 - Hi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here  - in camp. It's good to see some strong  - adventurers around here. -   - Many of our Sisters fought bravely  - against Diablo when he first attacked  - the town of Tristram. They came back  - to us true veterans, bearing some  - really powerful items. Seems like their  - victory was short-lived, though... Most  - of them are now corrupted by Andariel. - 
 getLocaleString(37)	54 - Wow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's  - really great to meet you. I've seen a  - few of your kind around here lately. I'm  - a little jealous... I wish I could go off  - adventuring with you. -   - Oh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the  - blacksmith here in camp. - 
 getLocaleString(38)	57 - You know, I've been with the Sisters for  - as long as I can remember. But Akara  - told me that my real parents were  - Barbarians from the northern tribes  - and that they were killed when I was  - very young. -   - Sometimes I wonder what my life would  - have been like if I had been raised as a  - Barbarian. -   - I don't know. I love being a blacksmith...  - but sometimes I just want to get out  - and explore the world, you know? - 
 getLocaleString(39)	86 - I don't really know anything about Cain.  - He seems to have a lot of secrets...  - That makes me nervous. - 
 getLocaleString(40)	51 - Oh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a  - little hard on outsiders, but who can  - blame her? All she wants is to protect  - our Order. But now that our Sisters  - have turned against us... I think this  - whole mess has hardened her heart. - 
 getLocaleString(41)	64 - Akara, our priestess and seer, is most  - upset by the corruption of our Sisters.  - I fear that she blames herself. - 
 getLocaleString(42)	80 - Warriv's all right, I guess. He seems too  - serious most of the time. I haven't  - really talked to him all that much. - 
 getLocaleString(43)	60 - Oh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He  - has all sorts of interesting stories from  - the places he's been. I wish I could see  - the sights he has. - 
 getLocaleString(44)	84 - I don't know why some of my Sisters  - chose to follow Andariel. Those who  - strayed were among our finest  - warriors. - 
 getLocaleString(45)	48 - Good day to you partner! I'm Gheed and  - I can already tell that I'll be your best  - friend in this forsaken camp. -   - A spare weapon, some gold, a small  - gem is all I want in exchange for the  - equipment you'll need on whatever  - quests you might undertake. -   - Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my  - items are guaranteed for life and come  - with a two-day warranty! - 
 getLocaleString(46)	46 - A Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have  - to lay my eyes on one of your kind  - again. ... The recent troubles in this  - area have brought out all kinds, I see.  - Nevertheless, your money's good... -   - A spare weapon, some gold, a small  - gem is all I want in exchange for the  - equipment you'll need on whatever  - quests you might undertake! -   - Now, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my  - items are guaranteed for life and come  - with a two-day warranty! - 
 getLocaleString(47)	74 - Don't think you can fool me,  - Necromancer. I've seen what your kind  - can do. If you're involved in any of the  - evil out there, I don't even want to  - know. Trade quickly and be about your  - business! - 
 getLocaleString(48)	57 - That old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet  - Quill Rat. I hear he survived whatever  - happened in Tristram. Personally, I  - wouldn't trust a thing he has to say. - 
 getLocaleString(49)	55 - Akara and Kashya are Sisters in the  - Order of the Sightless Eye, but they are  - worlds apart. Akara is a slow river of  - magic, and Kashya, a viper of war.  - They're both deeply devoted to their  - religious order, yet the corruption of  - their Sisters pains them both to no  - end. - 
 getLocaleString(50)	52 - Charsi is a fine girl..., but she has no  - business savvy! I know she means well,  - but the prices she charges for weapons  - and armor will never earn her a profit. -   - As long as I keep filling her mind with  - stories of adventure, she'll never catch  - on to the fact that I'm raking in gold  - hand over fist! - 
 getLocaleString(51)	55 - Warriv was kind enough to let me travel  - with his caravan, but don't let him drag  - you into a search for a new Eastern  - trade route. -   - I'm making a fortune right here... from  - the Rogues, of course! You, on the  - other hand, always get my best prices! - 
 getLocaleString(52)	61 - Andariel's demonic forces have taken up  - residence in the forests as well as the  - Monastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing  - out of the camp. So, if you need  - anything, I'll be right here. - 
 getLocaleString(53)	58 - When - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm  - going to find the largest bowl of  - Narlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly  - sense has left my body. - 
 getLocaleString(54)	43 - Long ago, the Soulstones were given to  - the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael.  - They were used to bind the three Prime  - Evils. I now know that even these holy  - artifacts were no match for Diablo's  - power. -   - I hope that his two brothers are more  - securely held... but I fear the worst. - 
 getLocaleString(55)	54 - It takes time to master your skills... and  - use will hone your technique. But take  - care to choose your new skills wisely. - 
 getLocaleString(56)	52 - You may recover some mysterious  - things from the demons you kill. Some  - of great use to you... some of great  - peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal  - their secrets. - 
 getLocaleString(57)	46 - Have I told you about the Horadrim?  - They were an ancient confederation of  - mage-clans who sought to bind the  - three Prime Evils for eternity. The  - Horadrim are now nearly forgotten...  - and it appears that the bonds they  - wove are unravelling! -   - As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that  - I can help you remedy their failure. - 
 getLocaleString(58)	43 - Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were  - cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It  - seems that Hell's balance has shifted,  - as Andariel is now aligned with the  - Lord of Terror. Her presence here in  - the mortal realm does not bode well for  - us. - 
 getLocaleString(59)	90 - Turn back! I can tell that you need more  - experience to fight safely in the next  - wilderness. - 
 getLocaleString(60)	46 - Halt! You should complete Akara's quest  - before venturing further. Search for  - the Den in the wilderness closer to  - camp. - 
 getLocaleString(61)	116 - Beware! The evil is strong ahead. - 
 getLocaleString(62)	92 - Beware! Beyond lies mortal danger for  - the likes of you! - 
 getLocaleString(63)	88 - Take care! The Corrupted Rogues in the  - wilderness ahead are not to be trifled  - with. - 
 getLocaleString(64)	43 - There is a place of great evil in the  - wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts  - have informed me that a cave nearby is  - filled with shadowy creatures and  - horrors from beyond the grave. -   - I fear that these creatures are massing  - for an attack against our encampment.  - If you are sincere about helping us,  - find the dark labyrinth and destroy the  - foul beasts. -   - May the Great Eye watch over you. - 
 getLocaleString(65)	46 - I should add that many Rogue scouts  - have died in that horrible place. We  - cannot afford to lose any more. If you  - choose to enter that Den of Evil, you  - must do so alone. - 
 getLocaleString(66)	87 - The demons in that cave have claimed  - many of my finest archers. I wonder  - how you will fare! - 
 getLocaleString(67)	95 - The beasts from the cave have begun to  - roam throughout the countryside.  - You'd better be careful out there. - 
 getLocaleString(68)	95 - You seem like a noble warrior. I hope  - you can help us. - 
 getLocaleString(69)	67 - You're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust  - my sacred scepter into the foulest,  - carbuncular trull than set one boot  - into that cave. - 
 getLocaleString(70)	122 - One who seeks that cave, seeks death. - 
 getLocaleString(71)	85 - Your task is not complete until you have  - killed all the demons in that cave. - 
 getLocaleString(72)	111 - You'd better come through on this. Your  - reputation depends on it. - 
 getLocaleString(73)	148 - You haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do  - you need anything? - 
 getLocaleString(74)	73 - Demons still befouling that cave, huh? I  - think you might need a new weapon. - 
 getLocaleString(75)	124 - One who hesitates... does so with good  - reason. - 
 getLocaleString(76)	65 - You have cleansed the Den of Evil.  - You've earned my trust and may yet  - restore my faith in humanity. -   - Your reward is training in the skill of  - your choice. - 
 getLocaleString(77)	74 - Hmm. I'm surprised you survived that  - test, outlander. Go see Akara. She may  - reward you. - 
 getLocaleString(78)	94 - You are truly brave and skillful...  Akara  - was worried about you. - 
 getLocaleString(79)	87 - The only good demon is a dead one, I  - say. -   - By the way, did you happen to find  - anything in that cave you'd like to sell? - 
 getLocaleString(80)	120 - ...That which does not kill you makes  - you stronger. - 
 getLocaleString(81)	56 - My Rogue scouts have just reported an  - abomination in the Monastery  - graveyard! -   - Apparently, Andariel is not content to  - take only our living. Blood Raven, one  - of our finest captains in the battle  - against Diablo at Tristram, was also  - one of the first to be corrupted by  - Andariel. -   - Now, you'll find her in the Monastery  - graveyard raising our dead as  - zombies! -   - We cannot abide this defilement! If you  - are truly our ally, you will help us  - destroy her. - 
 getLocaleString(82)	80 - Death has done nothing to weaken  - Blood Raven's combat skills. If  - anything, she's more deadly than ever. - 
 getLocaleString(83)	99 - Blood Raven was the leader of a Rogue  - band that once fought Diablo at  - Tristram. - 
 getLocaleString(84)	94 - I'm sorry... The undead are bad for  - trade. I have a strict no-return policy. - 
 getLocaleString(85)	51 - Blood Raven fought valiantly against  - Diablo in the catacombs beneath  - Tristram... She was never quite the  - same afterwards. It is now obvious she  - brought an evil influence back with her. - 
 getLocaleString(86)	140 - Hmmm... -   - How can one kill what is already dead? - 
 getLocaleString(87)	99 - Each moment you delay adds another  - undead Sister to Blood Raven's army. - 
 getLocaleString(88)	70 - If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear  - that our Order will perish forever. - 
 getLocaleString(89)	68 - Akara felt something was wrong even  - before Andariel descended upon us.  - She feared that Blood Raven had  - stumbled upon some evil force beneath  - Tristram. -   - I wish we had acted then... - 
 getLocaleString(90)	77 - I wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is  - among the undead? Oh, she had dirt on  - everybody. - 
 getLocaleString(91)	86 - When the dead return to prey upon the  - living, it is a terror beyond  - understanding. - 
 getLocaleString(92)	55 - I can hardly believe that you've defeated  - Blood Raven! -   - Though she was once my closest friend,  - I pray that her tortured spirit remains  - banished forever. -   - You have earned my respect, stranger...  - and the allegiance of the Rogues. I  - have placed several of my best  - warriors at your disposal. - 
 getLocaleString(93)	122 - Andariel must be made to pay for her  - sacrilege! - 
 getLocaleString(94)	77 - Kashya wishes to reward you for your  - defeat of Blood Raven. I thank you,  - too, even though Blood Raven was once  - my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(95)	148 - Some of those gals weren't so nice the  - first time around. - 
 getLocaleString(96)	104 - You've done well, stranger. I hope all  - your efforts are worth it. - 
 getLocaleString(97)	50 - It is clear that we are facing an Evil  - difficult to comprehend, let alone  - combat. -   - There is only one Horadrim sage,  - schooled in the most arcane history  - and lore, who could advise us... His  - name is Deckard Cain. -   - You must go to Tristram and find him,  - my friend. I pray that he still lives. - 
 getLocaleString(98)	90 - The bark of Inifuss holds mystical  - runes. -   - Akara can translate them... into our  - revenge! - 
 getLocaleString(99)	42 - Tristram is too far to journey by foot...   - Cain would likely be dead, when you  - arrived. However, there is a magical  - portal that will take you there  - instantly. -   - To open it, one must stand within the  - circle of Cairn Stones and touch them  - in a certain order. The proper order  - can be found in the runes written on  - the bark of the Tree of Inifuss. -   - You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss  - and bring back its bark. I will translate  - the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic  - pattern. - 
 getLocaleString(100)	117 - If you bring back the bark of Inifuss,  - Akara will tell you how to get to  - Tristram. - 
 getLocaleString(101)	68 - Months ago, I came across a few  - survivors from Tristram. They said  - that Cain had gone half-mad and could  - no longer distinguish fact from  - fantasy. - 
 getLocaleString(102)	98 - I would sooner micturate in a tankard  - of my own ale than journey to  - Tristram! - 
 getLocaleString(103)	150 - Without the bark of Inifuss you can't  - find Cain. - 
 getLocaleString(104)	76 - How will you find Cain without going to  - Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is  - the first step on your journey. - 
 getLocaleString(105)	96 - The Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but  - you'll know it when you see it. - 
 getLocaleString(106)	99 - Barking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll  - find it, just keep looking. - 
 getLocaleString(107)	70 - He who seeks that which cannot be  - found must look inside himself for  - further guidance... or look harder! - 
 getLocaleString(108)	82 - With this scroll you may open a portal  - back to Tristram. Only Akara can  - decipher its logic. - 
 getLocaleString(109)	168 - Get this to Akara. -   - Only she can understand it. - 
 getLocaleString(110)	72 - Look, friend... I trade a lot of strange  - items, but I'm not going to start  - dealing in bark. Okay? - 
 getLocaleString(111)	86 - This looks like gibberish to me. Akara  - may know what to make of it. - 
 getLocaleString(112)	64 - Ah, very good. I have translated the  - runes on this scroll. You must find the  - Cairn Stones and touch them in the  - order that I have written. - 
 getLocaleString(113)	103 - Deckard Cain has crucial knowledge  - about the Evils we face. You must find  - him! - 
 getLocaleString(114)	92 - I have heard that Tristram is now in  - ruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin  - of all of us. - 
 getLocaleString(115)	68 - I'm told that Tristram now resembles a  - mead hall... after a Barbarian wedding!  - I will wait here for your most glorious  - return. - 
 getLocaleString(116)	82 - It is too dangerous to travel to  - Tristram. I won't be leaving here until  - the way is clear! - 
 getLocaleString(117)	64 - If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in  - grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram  - before all is lost! - 
 getLocaleString(118)	82 - You have risked your life to rescue  - Cain. For that we thank you. -   - We must seek his counsel immediately. - 
 getLocaleString(119)	78 - Again, you amaze me, outlander. -   - The Sisterhood is grateful to you for  - delivering Cain to us. I believe Akara  - has something to tell you. - 
 getLocaleString(120)	53 - Ah, Cain is here... another customer. I  - haven't been this pleased since a  - love-starved maiden let down a bit  - more than her hair. - 
 getLocaleString(121)	102 - Akara wishes to reward you for your  - bravery in returning Deckard Cain. - 
 getLocaleString(122)	80 - Only a brave adventurer could return  - with Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward  - for your valor. - 
 getLocaleString(123)	74 - As a token of my gratitude, I will  - identify items for you at no charge. - 
 getLocaleString(124)	82 - ...I thank you, friend, for coming to my  - aid. - 
 getLocaleString(125)	75 - Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They  - finally rescued me from that cursed  - place! - 
 getLocaleString(126)	33 - Regrettably, I could do nothing to  - prevent the disaster which devastated  - Tristram. It would appear that our  - greatest fears have come to pass.  - Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once  - again been set loose upon the world! -   - As you know, some time ago Diablo was  - slain beneath Tristram.  And when our  - hero emerged triumphant from the  - labyrinth beneath town, we held a  - grand celebration that lasted several  - days. -   - Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero  - became increasingly aloof. He kept his  - distance from the rest of the townsfolk  - and seemed to lapse into a dark,  - brooding depression. I thought that  - perhaps his ordeal had been so  - disturbing that he simply could not put  - it out of his mind. -   - The hero seemed more tormented every  - passing day. I remember he awoke  - many times -- screaming in the night --  - always something about 'the East'. -   - One day, he simply left. And shortly  - thereafter Tristram was attacked by  - legions of foul demons. Many were  - slain, and the demons left me to die in  - that cursed cage. -   - I believe now that Tristram's hero was  - that Dark Wanderer who passed this  - way before the Monastery fell. -   - I fear even worse, my friend... I fear  - that Diablo has taken possession of the  - hero who sought to slay him. If true,  - Diablo will become more powerful than  - ever before. -   - You must stop him or all will be lost. - 
 getLocaleString(127)	36 - ...And so it came to pass that the  - Countess, who once bathed in the  - rejuvenating blood of a hundred  - virgins, was buried alive... And her  - castle in which so many cruel deeds  - took place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising  - over the buried dungeons in that  - god-forsaken wilderness, a solitary  - tower, like some monument to Evil, is  - all that remains. -   - The Countess' fortune was believed to  - be divided among the clergy, although  - some say that more remains unfound,  - still buried alongside the rotting skulls  - that bear mute witness to the  - inhumanity of the human creature. - 
 getLocaleString(128)	110 - The only wealth you're likely to find  - there is a wealth of vermin. - 
 getLocaleString(129)	70 - That old tower is as rotten on the inside  - as it appears on the outside. I heard  - that several Sisters came to a  - gruesome end when a stairwell  - collapsed on them. - 
 getLocaleString(130)	67 - The dangers there are not solely  - architectural. Once inside that  - wretched place, many succumb to a  - vile miasma. - 
 getLocaleString(131)	60 - That tower marks a place of danger.  - There is an epic poem about it...  How  - much sorrow one can stand was tested  - there. - 
 getLocaleString(132)	81 - Rumors of treasure are no different  - from rumors of any other kind. They  - hold false promise to those who should  - know better. - 
 getLocaleString(133)	78 - The tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we  - have found are death, delirium, and  - disappointment. - 
 getLocaleString(134)	151 - Have you suddenly lost your taste for  - wealth? - 
 getLocaleString(135)	94 - Quickly in and quickly out is all the  - advice I can give you. - 
 getLocaleString(136)	118 - Better an empty pocket than a full  - grave. - 
 getLocaleString(137)	170 - You're not ready to give up, are you? - 
 getLocaleString(138)	140 - There is no more I can tell you about  - that ancient tower. - 
 getLocaleString(139)	79 - Guess what! I've named a boil on my  - ass after you. It, too, bothers me every  - time I sit down. - 
 getLocaleString(140)	79 - Your rewards are well-earned. To us,  - the tower was nothing more than a  - headstone looming over a long  - forgotten grave. - 
 getLocaleString(141)	62 - Remember. Wealth is as insubstantial  - as a cloud and passes as quickly.  - Ignore Gheed. All that twitters is not  - bold. - 
 getLocaleString(142)	68 - Warriv's advice is like corpse gas; it  - befouls the air for a moment and then  - it disappears. - 
 getLocaleString(143)	58 - I thought the stories of treasure in the  - tower were nothing but lies. I am glad  - you found something of value in that  - death-trap. Would that our Sisters had  - been so fortunate. - 
 getLocaleString(144)	126 - Those riches will serve you well on the  - long road ahead. - 
 getLocaleString(145)	69 - Well done, my friend. Courage and  - opportunity together have created in  - you a kind of alchemy. - 
 getLocaleString(146)	66 - When I fled the Monastery, I left behind  - the Horadric Malus, my enchanted  - smithing hammer. If you can retrieve it  - for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen  - your equipment. - 
 getLocaleString(147)	51 - The Malus was forged and enchanted by  - the ancient Horadric Mages during the  - Sin Wars. When their union dissolved,  - the Malus was entrusted to the  - Sisterhood guarding the pass into the  - East. - 
 getLocaleString(148)	59 - The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is  - not without risk. Our Monastery is  - filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd  - best be careful, my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(149)	61 - Charsi is wasting her time and talents  - using an inferior hammer! Had she the  - Horadric Malus, she could make the  - steel sing and craft you a suit of armor  - as impenetrable as the Great Eye. - 
 getLocaleString(150)	87 - The Monastery can confuse even those  - who know it well. Stay alert in there. - 
 getLocaleString(151)	74 - Charsi talks of nothing anymore, but  - this Horadric Malus. Between you and  - her my ears need a rest. -   - Just find it and bring it back quickly. - 
 getLocaleString(152)	74 - I have offered my nomadic phallus, but  - to no avail. - 
 getLocaleString(153)	68 - Just as an archer needs bow and arrow,  - or a draughtsman pen and paper, so  - Charsi needs the Horadric Malus with  - which to ply her trade. - 
 getLocaleString(154)	57 - The Malus has eluded you so far. Well,  - search thoroughly in the Barracks...  - That is where the Rogues kept their  - forge. - 
 getLocaleString(155)	98 - If you can't carry out this quest, how  - will you face the greater evils ahead? - 
 getLocaleString(156)	71 - To do battle with Andariel requires  - more than thick skin and a strong will.  - You'll want armor and weaponry forged  - with the hammer's enchantments. - 
 getLocaleString(157)	89 - The Malus is a Horadric artifact of  - great power. Please bring it back. - 
 getLocaleString(158)	90 - I have heard that you bear us no Malus. - 
 getLocaleString(159)	120 - What better opportunity to show your  - mettle? - 
 getLocaleString(160)	59 - The magical effects imbued by the  - Malus are impossible to predict, but  - are always to the good. - 
 getLocaleString(161)	57 - Well done, my friend. But remember, the  - return of the Horadric Malus is but one  - step in reclaiming the Monastery. - 
 getLocaleString(162)	74 - Now that the Horadric Malus is back in  - our possession, we shall use it to  - deliver a great blow against the Evil  - which torments this land. - 
 getLocaleString(163)	72 - Oh! Thanks so much for returning the  - Horadric Malus! I will now imbue one of  - your items with magical powers. - 
 getLocaleString(164)	120 - I guess it's too late to take back some  - of the names I called you. - 
 getLocaleString(165)	118 - I am glad the hammer has returned and  - you with it. - 
 getLocaleString(166)	34 - It is certain that we face the demon  - queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the  - Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their  - ancestral Monastery. This does not  - bode well for us, my friend. -   - Ancient Horadric texts record that  - Andariel and the other Lesser Evils  - once overthrew the three Prime Evils --  - Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing  - them from Hell to our world. Here, they  - caused mankind untold anguish and  - suffering before they were finally  - bound within the Soulstones. -   - Andariel's presence here could mean  - that the forces of Hell are once again  - aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers.  - If this is true, then I fear for us all. -   - You must kill her before the Monastery  - becomes a permanent outpost of Hell  - and the way east lost forever. - 
 getLocaleString(167)	45 - Diablo is heading east for some foul  - purpose. And the only passage east is  - through the Monastery gate.  - Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel  - to block any pursuit. -   - For her part Andariel hopes to win  - Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are  - always vying for positions of power  - within the unholy hierarchy! - 
 getLocaleString(168)	63 - Andariel has desecrated all we hold  - dear. She must not be permitted to  - serve Diablo. -   - Destroy her! Her corruption of our  - Order must be undone! - 
 getLocaleString(169)	132 - Send Andariel back to the Hell she came  - from! - 
 getLocaleString(170)	71 - You're going after Andariel? -   - ... One of my wagon wheels is in need of  - repair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm  - needed. - 
 getLocaleString(171)	72 - The mapmakers tell us the shortest  - distance between two points is a  - straight line. -   - Our way east is a line that runs through  - Andariel's stronghold, the Monastery. - 
 getLocaleString(172)	81 - I can imagine a thousand different ways  - to kill Andariel. You need only choose  - one. - 
 getLocaleString(173)	48 - It is clear that Andariel is acting on  - behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone  - from following him eastward. Her  - defeat would allow you to continue the  - pursuit. -   - Ancient lore has it that while Andariel  - was spawned in the Burning Hells, she  - is not fond of fire. - 
 getLocaleString(174)	57 - You have done much to help us, but I  - sense that this has only fueled  - Andariel's fury. She will not stop until  - we are all dead. -   - You must kill Andariel before her army  - can gain the upper hand. - 
 getLocaleString(175)	72 - Have you stumbled upon that Demon  - Queen, yet? I hear she's quite the  - beauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish  - go, that is. - 
 getLocaleString(176)	108 - If you are the hero that you seem to be,  - now is the time to prove it. - 
 getLocaleString(177)	90 - May I remind you that my caravan can  - only go east, if the Monastery is  - cleansed? - 
 getLocaleString(178)	126 - Deckard Cain has important information  - about Andariel. - 
 getLocaleString(179)	64 - Finally, we may rejoice! -   - We owe you a debt we can never repay.  - I only hope that in time we will be able  - to rebuild our Order. -   - All our thanks go with you, my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(180)	86 - You'll probably go east now... It was  - good to know you. I hope you'll come  - back if you ever need anything. - 
 getLocaleString(181)	44 - Andariel's death brings about renewed  - life for us all. We mourn the loss of our  - dear Sisters, but at least now we can  - get on with our lives. -   - I... may have misjudged you, outlander.  - You are a true hero and testament to  - the noble spirit which has inspired our  - Order for generations. -   - Fare well... my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(182)	100 - I'm going to party like it's 999! - 
 getLocaleString(183)	82 - The caravan is prepared. We may now  - journey eastward to Lut Gholein. - 
 getLocaleString(184)	38 - This is a great victory indeed, but many  - more battles await. I will accompany  - you on your journey, lending what  - assistance I can...  -   - Remember... Diablo is still out there,  - seeking something in the desert. I'm  - afraid that this nightmare will not end  - until you find what it is that he seeks. - 
 getLocaleString(185)	600 - Halt. - 
 getLocaleString(186)	290 - You may not pass. - 
 getLocaleString(187)	255 - Welcome to the palace. - 
 getLocaleString(188)	255 - You may enter the palace. - 
 getLocaleString(189)	290 - Stay out of trouble. - 
 getLocaleString(190)	58 - I'll bet you wonder how this town  - manages to stay safe with all the  - trouble going on out in the desert.  - Well, I can tell you that it's got nothing  - to do with the local town guards...  - they're all in the palace for some  - reason. -   - Jerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to  - help keep the peace around here. We're  - not cheap, but we're the best this  - wasteland has to offer. - 
 getLocaleString(191)	85 - We do a good job in town, but beyond  - the city gates, you'll find all manner of  - demons. - 
 getLocaleString(192)	52 - The local guards were all relocated to  - the palace after the troubles began. No  - one really knows why. Actually, all of  - the town's brothel girls have been  - hiding out in the palace's cellar lately,  - so I assume that the guards have been  - assigned to 'protect them' with their  - lives. - 
 getLocaleString(193)	75 - I might spare you a few of my men.  - Why, enough gold can muster an army. - 
 getLocaleString(194)	61 - Jerhyn's got a nice little trading post  - going here. Despite his youth, he is a  - clever businessman. As you can see by  - that palace, he's done quite well for  - himself. - 
 getLocaleString(195)	99 - We're keeping the town safe and tight,  - but I've got a hunch there's something  - Jerhyn's not telling us. - 
 getLocaleString(196)	44 - Ah, Elzix is quite a character. I had a  - few run-ins with his band of outlaws in  - my younger years. Now, he's as settled  - as the dunes out there. The Desert Rain  - Inn is his pride and joy these days. - 
 getLocaleString(197)	53 - Atma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm  - sure the loss of her family has made  - her lonely. Perhaps I should go over  - and console her when I get off duty  - tonight... - 
 getLocaleString(198)	72 - Geglash is an imposing warrior, but he's  - never been able to back down from a  - fight. One of these days, his pride will  - be the death of him. - 
 getLocaleString(199)	67 - Meshif has sailed all around the  - southern seas and visited many  - strange lands. It must be driving him  - mad, having to stay anchored here. - 
 getLocaleString(200)	70 - I haven't talked much to Fara. She  - keeps to herself most of the time. I get  - the feeling that she doesn't like us  - mercenary types much. - 
 getLocaleString(201)	73 - I'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you.  - He's always mixing his damned potions  - and chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised  - if he winds up blowing himself to  - smithereens! - 
 getLocaleString(202)	85 - Drognan's a mystery to me. Then again,  - I never did trust mages much. - 
 getLocaleString(203)	61 - Hmm... You look like a sturdy  - adventurer. -   - You know, I used to be quite the  - scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest  - group of bandits who ever terrorized  - these sands! -   - Nowadays, I run this here Inn and  - pretty much stay out of trouble. -   - My days of adventuring are behind me. - 
 getLocaleString(204)	48 - Ah... You must be one of the new  - heroes who've come to rid our city of  - evil. Under any other circumstances, I'd  - be surprised to see one of your kind in  - the city. But lately... Oh, never mind all  - that... -   - You know, I used to be quite the  - scoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest  - group of bandits who ever terrorized  - these sands! -   - Nowadays, I run this here Inn and  - pretty much stay out of trouble. -   - My days of adventuring are behind me. - 
 getLocaleString(205)	52 - You know, I've lost a number of body  - parts over the years. An eye here, a leg  - there... -   - Say, do you know any spells that'd grow  - them back for me? Hmm... On second  - thought, I'll leave well enough alone. - 
 getLocaleString(206)	90 - What tales Drognan can tell... You  - would do well to listen carefully to that  - wizened wizard. - 
 getLocaleString(207)	80 - There are many ancient tombs in the  - desert. Most of them are already  - plundered, but I imagine that some  - have remained hidden. - 
 getLocaleString(208)	67 - I miss the brothels that used to do  - business here. -   - You know, all of the ladies fled to the  - palace as soon as the trouble in the  - desert started. You'd think that they  - could at least come out once in a while  - now that Greiz and his men have things  - relatively under control. - 
 getLocaleString(209)	71 - Atma... Now, there's a fine woman.  - Lately, though, she's only thinking  - about revenge. She has reason  - enough... - 
 getLocaleString(210)	71 - We've all fared well under Jerhyn's  - leadership. The town has remained  - safe throughout this whole mess; and  - yet the lad still seems very upset about  - something. - 
 getLocaleString(211)	88 - Geglash is a fool who would fight his  - own shadow if he could. Fighting's all  - he ever thinks about! - 
 getLocaleString(212)	74 - Meshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise  - enough to know silver from tin and  - truth from dung, that's for sure. - 
 getLocaleString(213)	65 - Fara is a good woman. She seems very  - sad, but seldom speaks of her past.  - She's good to the poor and helps  - people when she can. That makes her  - all right in my book. - 
 getLocaleString(214)	70 - That Lysander's a grumpy old cuss.  - You'd better not disturb him while he's  - working on his potions, or... BOOM!  - You could get blasted to the moon. - 
 getLocaleString(215)	62 - Now that Andariel is dead, I can return  - and outfit the Rogues properly. Once  - I've made some trades here, I'll be free  - to head back to their Monastery. Let  - me know if you want to travel along. - 
 getLocaleString(216)	106 - Caravans take people where they want  - to go - until they get there. - 
 getLocaleString(217)	80 - By ship is the only way eastward from  - here. I believe Captain Meshif has a  - small trading vessel moored at the  - docks. - 
 getLocaleString(218)	70 - There used to be a lot of brothels  - here... I guess the troubles scared all  - the women away, or maybe they're  - 'safe' in Jerhyn's palace. - 
 getLocaleString(219)	53 - That old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty  - as they come. Years back, he made off  - with a small fortune of my caravan's  - wares. I certainly never expected to see  - him so... domesticated. - 
 getLocaleString(220)	57 - Jerhyn has his father's strength and  - wits. He's young, but he rules this  - place with wisdom and care. I think  - he'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided  - we all survive this crisis. - 
 getLocaleString(221)	59 - You'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've  - suffered a loss recently, but that's not  - your problem. -   - It's a relief to see some proper warriors  - come through here. My name is Atma. I  - run the tavern here in Lut Gholein. - 
 getLocaleString(222)	86 - Evil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and  - you may be our last hope... - 
 getLocaleString(223)	56 - This public house used to be quite lively,  - until this plague of evil. Luckily, I've  - managed to save away a tidy nest egg.  - Unfortunately, I couldn't save  - everything I cared for... - 
 getLocaleString(224)	57 - In addition to my public house, there  - used to be several brothels doing  - business here. When the troubles first  - started in the desert, the harem guilds  - sought sanctuary within the palace. -   - Of course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll  - bet they're finding many ways to repay  - him for his protection. - 
 getLocaleString(225)	70 - Geglash may seem like a sot, but he's a  - brave man. All this trouble has driven  - him to drinking more than his usual. - 
 getLocaleString(226)	64 - Elzix and I have reached an  - understanding over the years. He  - sends travelers to me for drink and  - entertainment, and I send them back to  - him for a soft bed. The travelers often  - trade their wares for lodging. - 
 getLocaleString(227)	89 - Meshif seldom patronizes my  - establishment. I think he prefers to  - stay out there on his leaky ship. - 
 getLocaleString(228)	71 - Oh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good  - old man. He used to give me medicines  - when... my son was ill. - 
 getLocaleString(229)	78 - Drognan is a very private person. He's  - always studying ancient scrolls and  - such. He may be a mystery to me  - forever. - 
 getLocaleString(230)	57 - Bah! I don't know why you people keep  - pestering me. -   - Greiz seems to have this place locked  - down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't  - have done the same! I've proven my  - valor in combat plenty of times. - 
 getLocaleString(231)	43 - Hey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya?  - Ferocious as the wild beasts of the  - north, that's what they say. I suppose  - you've come to help save this city. You  - needn't bother. -   - Greiz seems to have this place locked  - down nice and tight. Not that I couldn't  - have done the same! I've proven my  - valor in combat plenty of times. - 
 getLocaleString(232)	46 - Hey, I heard that you Barbarians can  - wield multiple weapons at once. I never  - learned to fight two-handed. Carrying a  - sword and a wineskin at the same time  - is all I can ever handle. - 
 getLocaleString(233)	53 - Sure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did  - you hear about the harem guilds? They  - were the only ones allowed to hide out  - in the palace when the raids started! -   - Ah... It figures. - 
 getLocaleString(234)	64 - I've killed plenty of those demons out in  - the desert. It doesn't seem to slow  - them down any, though... they just  - keep coming back for more. - 
 getLocaleString(235)	55 - Have you found those big sand maggots  - yet? Arrows and all that don't work so  - well against them. Best thing is to hack  - 'em with a sword or such. - 
 getLocaleString(236)	58 - There are some ancient tombs out there  - in the desert. You have to go pretty far  - to find them, though. Rumor has it that  - they're crawling with walking corpses  - now. -   - As if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers  - weren't bad enough. - 
 getLocaleString(237)	67 - Yeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be  - damned if I ever get on his ship. I don't  - even like to drink water. - 
 getLocaleString(238)	52 - Jerhyn's been acting strange lately. I  - can't imagine why he recalled the town  - guards into the palace. If there is  - something wrong in there, I hope he  - doesn't expect me to handle it. - 
 getLocaleString(239)	57 - I've seen Fara defend herself against a  - few drunken ruffians. She's got moves  - I've never even seen before. Wherever  - she's from, she sure learned how to  - fight there. - 
 getLocaleString(240)	83 - I've got no time for old alchemists.  - Lysander would be completely useless  - in a real fight. - 
 getLocaleString(241)	63 - Greetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this  - ship here. I make port runs around the  - Twin Seas and occasionally out to  - Kingsport in Westmarch. -   - I haven't sailed anywhere lately,  - though... Jerhyn has ordered me to  - stay docked here in case of emergency. - 
 getLocaleString(242)	54 - Greetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one  - of your kind in many years.... It's good  - to know that warriors of your caliber  - are protecting this city. -   - I'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I  - make port runs around the Twin Seas  - and occasionally out to Kingsport in  - Westmarch. -   - I haven't sailed anywhere lately,  - though... Jerhyn has ordered me to  - stay docked here in case of emergency. - 
 getLocaleString(243)	62 - I was wondering if you've heard any  - news from Kurast? I know you  - Amazons travel extensively. Have you  - been there recently? -   - Hmm... Well, I hope the port opens  - soon. I need to get home to Kurast and  - find out what's been happening there. - 
 getLocaleString(244)	72 - There's something Jerhyn's not telling  - me, I just don't know what. To my eye,  - things here in town don't look that bad,  - especially since Warriv's caravan route  - opened up. - 
 getLocaleString(245)	65 - I've been all around the seas in these  - parts. It's dangerous sailing west this  - time of year, though. Until the season  - changes, the caravan through the  - desert is the main trade route to  - Westmarch. - 
 getLocaleString(246)	75 - My ship is the only way East from here.  - Still, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may  - not leave until the current crisis is  - over. - 
 getLocaleString(247)	65 - Oh, I've known Elzix for years. He  - always offers me a free room at his Inn  - when I dock here, but I prefer the  - comforts of my own cabin. - 
 getLocaleString(248)	61 - Warriv is a good friend. We've shared  - many tales, he and I. If we had it all to  - do over again, I believe we'd both be  - explorers of some renown. - 
 getLocaleString(249)	69 - Greiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I  - hope he can handle it if those things in  - the desert decide to attack this town. - 
 getLocaleString(250)	130 - Atma serves a fine ale in her  - establishment. - 
 getLocaleString(251)	70 - Hah! That braggart Geglash says he  - fears neither man nor beast. Yet, when  - I offer to take him out to sea, he  - quakes with fear. - 
 getLocaleString(252)	130 - The lady Fara has a proud, noble air  - about her. - 
 getLocaleString(253)	41 - Greetings, honored traveler. I am  - Jerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid  - you welcome to my fair port-city. I'm  - glad to know that once again caravans  - are free to travel through the Western  - Pass. -   - For some time now, we have been under  - siege by an evil power that I cannot  - identify. Strange... It all began when a  - Dark Wanderer came this way, looking  - for the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one  - knows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper  - of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain  - to be far out in the desert. -   - Now, my people whisper tales of the  - dead rising from their tombs and  - horrible creatures lurking amongst the  - moonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed  - things which I cannot explain. I've  - ordered the port closed and all trade  - ships moored until I am sure that my  - city is safe. -   - Atma, the tavernkeeper, has an  - important mission for you. Go see her  - immediately. You'll find her on the  - other side of town. -   - Now, I must return to the palace. I  - apologize, but I can't invite you in.  - Things are... rather a mess right now. - 
 getLocaleString(254)	51 - For trade in magic and the like, see  - Drognan or Lysander. Drognan is the  - wisest man I know - without equal in  - magic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander  - is nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion  - chemist. -   - For travel back west, see Warriv, whom  - you already know. -   - Our own Fara is a fine and honest  - armorer, and she can heal wounds as  - well. -   - Elzix is the Innkeeper and may also  - have some items to trade. -   - Greiz, the mercenary captain I hired to  - secure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps  - order in town, as well. -   - There are others here, too. I'm sure  - you'll meet most of them. Just look  - around... - 
 getLocaleString(255)	117 - Things are getting worse by the hour. I  - know everything looks fine, but trust  - me, it isn't! - 
 getLocaleString(256)	117 - Things are getting worse by the hour. I  - know everything looks fine, but trust  - me, it isn't! - 
 getLocaleString(257)	63 - To any who aid me in the defense of Lut  - Gholein, I pledge my support. Passage  - East, wealth, honor - all are due to  - those who help my city. - 
 getLocaleString(258)	71 - You seem very capable, but no offense  - is intended when I say that I must  - choose my confidants carefully. It  - wouldn't do to have rumors sending  - everyone into a panic. - 
 getLocaleString(259)	87 - Even though he was once a bandit, I  - permitted Elzix to take over the Desert  - Rain Inn. He has been quite civilized  - ever since. - 
 getLocaleString(260)	76 - When you arrived, Warriv's caravan had  - been long overdue. With all of the evil  - that's arisen in the land, I'm surprised  - he got through at all. - 
 getLocaleString(261)	77 - Meshif is an honorable man, but I fear  - that he is growing impatient with me  - about impounding his ship. I dare not  - tell him what's really happening in this  - city. - 
 getLocaleString(262)	98 - The woman, Atma, may have some  - useful gossip for you. She can always  - be found near her public house. - 
 getLocaleString(263)	81 - I know much about the ancient  - religions. I was trained as a Paladin of  - Zakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple  - many years ago. - 
 getLocaleString(264)	103 - Welcome, brother Paladin. -   - I am Fara. I was once a devout  - champion of Zakarum. - 
 getLocaleString(265)	67 - Perhaps, in time, you will play a part in  - reclaiming our Order's honor and  - spirit. You are an inspiration to me,  - brother Paladin. - 
 getLocaleString(266)	60 - The shrines in the desert are leftover  - artifacts from the great Sin War that  - ravaged these lands almost a thousand  - years ago. They still function, but most  - travelers believe them only to be  - remnants of the distant past. - 
 getLocaleString(267)	54 - I've no love for brothels, as they can  - lead honorable men to do dishonorable  - things. Since the local harems took up  - hiding in the palace, however, there  - seems to be a rise in foul tempers. - 
 getLocaleString(268)	66 - When the Three Evils were bound ages  - ago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was  - moved to Kurast and bound by the  - holiest of magics. - 
 getLocaleString(269)	79 - Warriv may not remember me, but I  - helped him out when I was a young  - Paladin. There's no need for me to  - remind him. The rewards for honor will  - not come in this life. - 
 getLocaleString(270)	68 - Greiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in  - his heart, he will always be a  - mercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to  - those who have no loyalty to  - themselves. - 
 getLocaleString(271)	90 - Atma is a good, loving woman. But I  - fear she will succumb to her despair  - and hatred. - 
 getLocaleString(272)	95 - Geglash is too confident in his abilities.  - A warrior's true strength is in his  - heart. - 
 getLocaleString(273)	94 - Meshif is an honest man as far as I can  - tell. He has never pestered me about  - my past. - 
 getLocaleString(274)	61 - How do I know I can trust you? Hmm? -   - You may be as shifty as that pack rat,  - Elzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you  - need a potion, though, I suppose I can  - make you one... for a price, of course. - 
 getLocaleString(275)	109 - Potions are delicate mixtures. They're  - just as liable to go off in your face as  - anything. - 
 getLocaleString(276)	65 - Ah... The sweetest desert flower - that's  - Atma. Even my strongest brew can't  - bring back her family, though. - 
 getLocaleString(277)	86 - There are some ancient enchanted  - fountains in the desert that can heal  - your wounds - if you drink enough from  - them. - 
 getLocaleString(278)	71 - Oh. Deafness has its advantages, you  - know. I'm no longer forced to overhear  - the tedious gossip of others. - 
 getLocaleString(279)	54 - I never patronized the brothels, mind  - you. But since those ladies took up  - hiding in the palace, there certainly has  - been less scenery to feast my eyes on. - 
 getLocaleString(280)	95 - Oh... I have great faith in Greiz. He  - seems to have things well in hand. - 
 getLocaleString(281)	90 - I've traded my potions to Warriv many  - times. Yes. They seem to fetch a good  - price in the western lands. - 
 getLocaleString(282)	71 - I've sold many sea-sickness potions to  - Meshif over the years. It seems that  - many of his passengers don't take well  - to the rocking of his ship on the open  - seas. - 
 getLocaleString(283)	58 - Oh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase  - minor love potions from me, hoping to  - win the favors of the harem girls. -   - But now that the girls have taken up  - residence in the palace, he doesn't  - come around here anymore. Well,  - well... I've always said, 'alchemy is no  - substitute for experience'. - 
 getLocaleString(284)	57 - Drognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of  - mine. I help him find exotic spell  - components and alchemical books from  - time to time. I think he used to be a  - sorcerer of great renown, but he  - doesn't like to talk about his past. - 
 getLocaleString(285)	61 - I've heard that you are responsible for  - banishing Andariel back to the Burning  - Hells. I'm impressed, stranger. That  - couldn't have been easy. -   - My name is Drognan and I know what  - you're up against, my friend. -   - You ought to look over my inventory of  - items for trade. - 
 getLocaleString(286)	50 - Welcome, young Sorceress, to Lut  - Gholein. I hope your skills are a match  - for the horrors that lie beyond the  - city's walls. A mage of your limited  - experience may find the evil too great  - to withstand alone. -   - My name is Drognan and I know what  - you're up against, my friend. -   - You ought to look over my inventory of  - items for trade. - 
 getLocaleString(287)	74 - Many of the Mage Clans feel that  - women shouldn't practice magic  - openly. But since you've made it this  - far, I must say that you have proven  - your right to do so. - 
 getLocaleString(288)	57 - The Horadrim were a powerful Order,  - although maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha  - was one of their Order. And that  - should tell you something. -   - Any man who believes himself strong  - enough to contain one of the Prime  - Evils is in for a rude awakening, I  - should think. - 
 getLocaleString(289)	78 - I have heard of your friend, Cain. He is  - the last of the Horadrim. You would do  - well to heed whatever advice he has to  - give you. - 
 getLocaleString(290)	53 - Not long ago, one of my Vizjerei  - comrades, who I believed had died in  - Tristram, came to this city. He seemed  - quite insane, so I dismissed much of  - what he said. -   - However, he was able to talk his way  - into Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen  - him since. I fear that fool may have  - found something in the palace that led  - to his doom. - 
 getLocaleString(291)	68 - I've been practicing magic for more  - years than you could know. I'm older  - than I look, though not so old that I  - can't conjure up a few sparks. - 
 getLocaleString(292)	67 - Elzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of  - course, he never tries to cheat me. He  - knows what my magic skills can do. - 
 getLocaleString(293)	86 - Demons have spread throughout the  - desert wasteland and threaten to  - engulf our quiet port-city. - 
 getLocaleString(294)	88 - Meshif and his vessel should remain  - here, lest we risk taking demonic  - stowaways to other lands. - 
 getLocaleString(295)	58 - When the recent troubles began, Lord  - Jerhyn came seeking my council. I  - advised him to close the port and put  - the town under strict watch. -   - Lately, though, he's been occupied  - within the palace. I doubt his whores  - could divert him from his civic duties  - for this long, though. - 
 getLocaleString(296)	68 - Lysander is harmless enough. We keep  - each other company with our mutual  - interests, yet I don't think he could  - handle the enormity of our present  - situation. - 
 getLocaleString(297)	48 - Greetings, my friend. Have you spoken  - to Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable  - leader for being such a young man.  - Then again, the old blood has always  - run strong in this land. - 
 getLocaleString(298)	71 - There is something about Fara that  - troubles me. Her manner is strange for  - a lonely desert-maid. - 
 getLocaleString(299)	70 - Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him  - all the same. - 
 getLocaleString(300)	59 - I talked at length with Warriv as we  - crossed the desert from Khanduras. He  - has many fascinating tales of the  - dangers in the desert. His experience  - may be useful to you. - 
 getLocaleString(301)	57 - Meshif is an interesting man. Part of  - him longs for the freedom of the open  - seas... Yet his heart belongs in his  - homeland. - 
 getLocaleString(302)	42 - I thank you, mortal, for my freedom.  - But I did expect you earlier. -   - I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here  - to prevent Diablo from freeing his  - brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now,  - Terror and Destruction roam free  - throughout your world. -   - Even now, they head towards the  - Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very  - heart of the Zakarum Temple. There  - they hope to find their eldest brother,  - Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was  - imprisoned there ages ago. -   - If the three Prime Evils unite, they will  - be invincible. Though it is unclear as to  - what their aims are, it is certain that  - they must be stopped at all costs. -   - I am broken and the energies that tie  - me to this world are diminishing  - rapidly. -   - You must take up this quest and  - prevent the Three Brothers from  - reuniting. You must cross the sea and  - search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast. -   - Now hurry, mortal... Time is running  - out for all of us! - 
 getLocaleString(303)	50 - Hey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if  - you leave town now. - 
 getLocaleString(304)	50 - I don't expect this of you, but if you  - want to help me, I would be grateful. -   - In the sewers below our city, there lurks  - a horrid creature that hungers for  - human flesh. The creature has killed  - many, including my son and my  - husband. -   - If you destroy it, I will reward you.  - Please be careful though, that beast  - has taken enough from us already. -   - The sewer entrance is through the trap  - door just up the street. - 
 getLocaleString(305)	52 - I've personally found some of that  - devil's victims washed up out of the  - sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or  - a head, and their bodies have always  - been skinned. -   - At first the creature raided the town at  - night... That's how Atma lost her  - family. Now we've got him barricaded  - in the sewers. -   - You're safe up here on the surface, but  - every now and again some fool wants  - to be a hero and heads down to the  - waste tunnels with a pig-sticker. - 
 getLocaleString(306)	68 - I hear that the creature kills his victims  - in order to hack off their limbs! I guess  - that makes me a less likely candidate,  - eh? - 
 getLocaleString(307)	84 - I've heard tales of walking corpses out  - in the desert at night, though I've never  - actually seen one. - 
 getLocaleString(308)	77 - Hey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a  - hole into your skull with my thumb. - 
 getLocaleString(309)	54 - I believe that the creature you refer to  - is one of the ancient Horadric  - mummies from the tombs that lie  - buried beneath the desert sands. It is  - unusual for one of his kind to be so far  - away from his resting place. I sense in  - this entity a restless and malevolent  - spirit. - 
 getLocaleString(310)	62 - The creature makes its lair in the  - tunnels beneath this city. He butchered  - my husband and son... I simply cannot  - bear to talk about it... - 
 getLocaleString(311)	63 - There are two entrances to the sewers,  - I believe. One of them is right near  - here, down by the water beneath the  - docks. I can see it from my ship, and  - you can bet I keep an eye on it every  - night. - 
 getLocaleString(312)	53 - Fara and I have been talking about the  - creature recently. From my studies, I  - have deduced that it is Radament the  - Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy  - that has for some reason left his tomb  - to prey on mortals. -   - I'm doing some more research now. If  - you check back later, I may have some  - more insight as to his nature. - 
 getLocaleString(313)	94 - I hear that beast is after body parts.  - Does he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly! - 
 getLocaleString(314)	48 - The Horadrim used to mummify their  - highest mages, and infuse them with  - spells that would allow them to protect  - their tombs, even after death. -   - I have no idea why one of them would  - be acting so malevolently. Perhaps  - Drognan or Fara would know more  - about this. - 
 getLocaleString(315)	90 - Death is not afraid of the living, but the  - living abhor death. - 
 getLocaleString(316)	55 - I noticed a rotting, human arm floating  - in the harbor this morning. I suspected  - foul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't  - seem too concerned since there haven't  - been any folk reported missing lately. - 
 getLocaleString(317)	83 - I am starting to have second thoughts  - about my request... I couldn't bear the  - thought of you losing your life on my  - behalf. -   - Please be careful. - 
 getLocaleString(318)	69 - We've been meaning to send an  - organized group down there to kill that  - thing, but it would be dangerous. We  - just can't afford the chance of losing  - any men with all the trouble that's  - going on in the desert. - 
 getLocaleString(319)	65 - Ah-hah! Back for a small shot of  - courage... Believe me, it doesn't help  - for long. -   - Drinks, barkeep! - 
 getLocaleString(320)	69 - If you're going to fight that thing, use  - some common sense. Be knowledgeable  - about what harms the undead. Poison,  - for instance, will have little effect. - 
 getLocaleString(321)	64 - Huh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes,  - yes. Ooh, a foul creature... -   - Some of my exploding potions should do  - quite nicely against him. They usually  - work well against the undead. - 
 getLocaleString(322)	49 - I've just been reading something  - interesting about this sort of undead.  - Apparently, certain Horadric funereal  - priests altered the bodies of their dead  - mages with magical and surgical  - techniques -- often replacing body  - parts with those of animals. -   - This was thought to augment their  - powers, and raise their status in the  - afterlife. - 
 getLocaleString(323)	68 - Drognan told me something interesting  - earlier today. It might explain why  - Radament is so restless, and it might  - have something to do with why he is  - stealing human body parts. - 
 getLocaleString(324)	41 - The Horadric mummies were created to  - protect the tombs, but Radament is far  - from his burial chamber. Given the  - aberrations that have been witnessed  - lately, it comes as no surprise that  - even the ancient guardian spells have  - begun to unravel. Be wary of this as  - you venture farther into the desert. - 
 getLocaleString(325)	76 - You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite  - a nice piece of work! If you ever need a  - job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to  - sign ya' up. - 
 getLocaleString(326)	52 - From what you tell me, it would seem  - that Radament was bent on the task of  - reviving his own mummified corpse  - with the flesh of the living. -   - This is very unusual indeed. It takes an  - incredible magic power to alter the  - singular purpose of an undead mind. -   - Perhaps there is a power at work here  - which is beyond my ken. - 
 getLocaleString(327)	61 - Uh... Little of what I am able to hear is  - of any value. Radament's death,  - however, is news worth hearing. I'm  - sure Atma will be glad to hear of this. - 
 getLocaleString(328)	62 - Good job mate! At night out on my ship,  - I was often awakened by that fiend's  - awful moaning. I bet I rest easier now. - 
 getLocaleString(329)	41 - Whoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it? -   - I've fallen off many a barstool and no  - one calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They  - might go so far as to say, 'Geglash,  - you've fallen!' - 
 getLocaleString(330)	70 - We ran into one of those old tomb  - guardians when I ran with my bandits.  - I know they aren't easy foes to face, so  - you sure have my respect. Have you  - told Atma yet? - 
 getLocaleString(331)	142 - Atma's been telling everyone what  - you've done for her. - 
 getLocaleString(332)	102 - As you have helped Atma and all of us,  - so shall I help you. - 
 getLocaleString(333)	57 - If you haven't already, tell Atma that  - Radament is dead. It may help to ease  - the weight of her mourning. - 
 getLocaleString(334)	50 - They say that the taste of vengeance is  - bittersweet, but I find it to my liking.  -   - In addition to my undying gratitude, I  - have spoken on your behalf with the  - rest of the townspeople. The  - merchants have agreed to show their  - gratitude by offering their wares and  - services at lower rates. -   - Oh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too.  - You'll find him in front of the palace. - 
 getLocaleString(335)	37 - Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a  - fortunate turn of events... -   - As the last living Horadrim, I alone have  - knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read  - the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm... -   - The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal  - within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off  - his Burial Chamber from the mortal  - realm. Those same Mages also crafted  - fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued  - them with the special power to open  - the Chamber's hidden door. -   - After nearly losing one to the thievery  - of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all  - the Horadric Staves into two parts -  - wooden shaft and metal headpiece -  - hiding them separately to safeguard  - them. -   - The Horadrim foresaw our current  - plight and designed the hiding places  - to reveal themselves to worthy heroes  - like you. -   - Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff  - and unite them using a Horadric Cube.  - Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial  - Chamber. - 
 getLocaleString(336)	50 - The Viper Amulet you bear is actually  - the headpiece of a Horadric Staff! -   - Yes... You have an uncanny knack for  - finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of  - course, you'll have to use a Horadric  - Cube to combine the headpiece with the  - shaft. - 
 getLocaleString(337)	56 - The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my  - friend. You have discovered the shaft  - portion of a Horadric Staff. -   - I trust you know how to use a Horadric  - Cube to unite the shaft with its  - headpiece. - 
 getLocaleString(338)	40 - You have quite a treasure there in that  - Horadric Cube. According to Horadric  - lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric  - Staff. -   - To do it - use the Cube as you would a  - scroll. When the Cube opens, place  - both pieces of the Staff into it and use  - the Cube's transmute power. -   - You'll be pleased to know that the Cube  - has other alchemical uses as well... -   - Six gems plus one sword transmute into  - a socketed long sword. -   - You may also transmute two quivers of  - crossbow bolts into one quiver of  - arrows, while two quivers of arrows  - yield one quiver of bolts. -   - I must leave it to you to discover other  - formulae. - 
 getLocaleString(339)	46 - Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff. -   - Carry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb.  - Find within the Tomb the chamber  - whose floor is inset with the Circle of  - Seven Symbols. -   - Place the Staff into the receptacle you  - find there. That will open the secret  - passage into Tal Rasha's Burial  - Chamber. -   - But, be prepared for a fight - you'll  - likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy  - Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(340)	110 - My astrologers failed to predict this  - eclipse. You should seek Drognan's  - advice. - 
 getLocaleString(341)	71 - This midday darkness reeks of foul  - magic! My men and I are trying to keep  - the peace, but this kind of thing really  - scares people. - 
 getLocaleString(342)	65 - Two men arrived late last night bearing  - a story about evil magic. They said  - they saw a gathering of giant snake  - creatures performing some arcane  - ritual. They sound like the Serpent Men  - of the desert. - 
 getLocaleString(343)	72 - The sun has grown disgusted with the  - terrible deeds it must shine upon each  - day. Damnation is upon us all. - 
 getLocaleString(344)	121 - Drognan, the wizard, will have some  - idea as to what is happening. - 
 getLocaleString(345)	100 - This whole place is one big ale fog. - 
 getLocaleString(346)	70 - This unnatural nightfall is no doubt  - caused by evil sorcery. Drognan might  - know what we are dealing with. - 
 getLocaleString(347)	65 - Claw Vipers! This outer darkness  - mirrors the inner blackness of their  - souls. It is they who have eclipsed the  - sun, I'll wager. They are a venomous  - band. - 
 getLocaleString(348)	77 - I've been researching this lengthy  - eclipse and I believe it to be the work  - of Claw Vipers. -   - Find their temple beneath the desert  - sands and you may find the source of  - this curse. - 
 getLocaleString(349)	76 - This permanent darkness is very  - unsettling. Hmmm... It would make  - navigation by stars easier for me,  - though. - 
 getLocaleString(350)	62 - Drognan may have some advice on this  - matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with  - him myself. - 
 getLocaleString(351)	130 - This eclipse is a definite manifestation  - of evil. - 
 getLocaleString(352)	73 - Don't worry! My men and I have an iron  - grip on this town. If those cursed Claw  - Vipers are plotting anything against  - us, we'll be prepared for 'em. - 
 getLocaleString(353)	73 - The calculated coldness of the reptilian  - brain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny  - adversaries. - 
 getLocaleString(354)	49 - It's strange when the morning after the  - night before... is still the same night. - 
 getLocaleString(355)	105 - I've had about enough of this darkness.  - I don't even know what day it is  - anymore. - 
 getLocaleString(356)	77 - The Claw Vipers practice evil magic.  - They have also been known to kidnap  - travelers and sacrifice them to their  - dark gods. - 
 getLocaleString(357)	82 - Well... I don't know much about the  - habits of Claw Vipers, to be honest.  - Drognan will probably know something  - about the nature of the magic at work. - 
 getLocaleString(358)	51 - I've discovered a reference to a similar  - eclipse several hundred years ago. It  - says that some desert-dwelling snake  - demons had erected an evil altar,  - which caused the sun to go black. -   - Perhaps we are dealing with something  - similar here. Look for an altar in the  - Claw Viper temple. - 
 getLocaleString(359)	94 - I usually charge for rooms by the night. -   - But I may have to soon change that. - 
 getLocaleString(360)	57 - The source of this spell is probably a  - magical altar. It will not be enough to  - kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the  - spell you must destroy the altar. - 
 getLocaleString(361)	80 - I was going to go to bed, but then I  - realized that I have no idea what time  - it is. It could be the crack of dawn, for  - all I know. - 
 getLocaleString(362)	96 - The sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm  - beginning to like you, traveler. - 
 getLocaleString(363)	219 - I'm glad that's over with! - 
 getLocaleString(364)	74 - Ahh... It takes but one eye to revel in  - the beauty of our restored sun. - 
 getLocaleString(365)	60 - So, this is daylight... It's over-rated. - 
 getLocaleString(366)	80 - With renewed daylight, one may gather  - the wits that were scattered about like  - restrictive undergarments in the  - darkness. - 
 getLocaleString(367)	130 - So... Did you plunder any booty? - 
 getLocaleString(368)	132 - You have done well to restore light to  - our world. - 
 getLocaleString(369)	87 - Drognan seems to have taken you into  - his confidence. This is good, for you  - will benefit from his wisdom. - 
 getLocaleString(370)	69 - Ahhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical  - artifacts. Did you happen to find one in  - their temple? - 
 getLocaleString(371)	69 - You did well in destroying the Claw  - Vipers. We are all glad to see the sun  - returned to its former glory. - 
 getLocaleString(372)	48 - I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and  - I sense that he is becoming more and  - more agitated by something. You  - should try to talk to him again. -   - If he still won't take you into his  - confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit  - more. I gather that his respect for you  - is growing. - 
 getLocaleString(373)	41 - I've been researching the old records,  - trying to find the location of Tal  - Rasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found  - the Tomb, itself, I may have a good  - lead for you. -   - The great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon,  - built his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere  - around here. He was a powerful  - spellcaster and kept demons as slaves  - within the Sanctuary. He kept a close  - eye on great events, too -- such as the  - imprisonment of Baal within Tal  - Rasha's Tomb. -   - If you could find Horazon's Sanctuary,  - I'm sure that it would hold some clue  - as to the Tomb's location. Though I  - doubt Horazon is still alive, you must  - proceed with caution. There's no telling  - what could be waiting inside. -   - When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn,  - he asked that I send you to him.  - Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance  - or the like. - 
 getLocaleString(374)	46 - Ah, the ancient mage Horazon! He  - believed that he could bend Evil forces  - to his will. What he didn't know was  - that Evil uses man, not the reverse. -   - The Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol  - of man's ability to triumph over other  - worldly forces. The Church of Light,  - however, cites him as an example of  - man's folly. - 
 getLocaleString(375)	89 - The only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the  - harem girls that have been hiding there  - since the troubles began. - 
 getLocaleString(376)	62 - An 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the  - palace? I'd heard that there were some  - underground cellar levels that Jerhyn  - used as chambers for his treasure and  - such, but no Arcane Sanctuary. - 
 getLocaleString(377)	44 - When the troubles began here, I allowed  - the terrified Harem guilds to join me  - within the safety of the palace. All was  - fine, until one night... -   - Screams echoed up the stairwells from  - the harem. My guards arrived to find  - the poor girls being slaughtered by a  - merciless band of hell-spawned  - demons. My brave guardsmen tried to  - push the demons back into the  - mysterious rift from which they came. -   - Ever since, my men have fought a losing  - battle. Demons have continued to pour  - through the rift into the palace.  - Ultimately, I hired Greiz and his  - mercenaries to help protect the rest of  - my fair city. -   - Drognan believes that the Arcane  - Sanctuary lies buried underneath this  - palace, since Lut Gholein occupies the  - site of an ancient Vizjerei fortress. -   - My palace is open to you now... Take  - care. - 
 getLocaleString(378)	45 - I very much doubt that Horazon still  - lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed  - great power and influence over  - demons, but even that may not have  - been enough in the end. One of his  - notoriety cannot easily remove himself  - from the vengeful reach of Hell. - 
 getLocaleString(379)	60 - Look, look... I'm just about as tough and  - arrogant as they come, but you'd never  - catch me trying to tame a demon for a  - pet. That's just asking for a lot of  - trouble. - 
 getLocaleString(380)	75 - Arcane Sanctuary? That place sounds  - awful! Even if you find a way into it,  - what makes you think you'll be able to  - leave again? - 
 getLocaleString(381)	73 - A careful caravan gives wide berth to  - sleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone,  - let him remain so. - 
 getLocaleString(382)	49 - Horazon found it necessary to lock  - himself up for all time, just to protect  - himself from those angry demons.  - Such is the fate of one who practices  - the summoning arts... that, or eternal  - damnation. There's old summoners and  - bold summoners, but no old, bold  - summoners. - 
 getLocaleString(383)	42 - Nearly a thousand years ago, Horazon  - rose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage  - clan. Horazon used the knowledge of  - the Vizjerei to summon and control  - demons from Hell. -   - Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon  - feared that the Lords of Hell would  - punish him for enslaving their  - brethren. Thus, the Summoner created  - for himself an Arcane Sanctuary. -   - He believed that his Sanctuary would  - not only protect him from Hell's  - vengeance, but also allow him to  - continue his studies free from the  - ravages of time and disease. -   - Horazon had crafted many wondrous  - scrying devices through which he  - observed the events of the world  - outside. It is certain that he took  - careful study of Tal Rasha's  - imprisonment and recorded the  - location of his forgotten Tomb. -   - The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to  - have been constructed here in Lut  - Gholein. An entrance may be hidden  - somewhere in the palace, as that  - building is very old, and was once a  - Vizjerei fortress. - 
 getLocaleString(384)	57 - Ahh... The legend of Horazon is an old  - one, especially around these parts. You  - wouldn't believe the feats and strange  - events that are attributed to him. - 
 getLocaleString(385)	63 - I understand that you've been talking to  - Jerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first  - in a long while... since the trouble  - began, actually. -   - Do us a favor and try to find out what's  - got Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK? - 
 getLocaleString(386)	48 - There was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei,  - I believe... who visited me almost a  - year ago. He was very interested in the  - history of this site, and he seemed  - particularly fascinated with the palace  - architecture. -   - I gave him a tour. When he found the  - ancient seals over a passageway in the  - cellar, he became very agitated. He  - asked for some time alone to study  - them, and I granted it. -   - Shortly after, he left with no further  - word and I never saw him again. Odd...  - Don't you think? - 
 getLocaleString(387)	61 - What's got you so occupied in the  - palace? Don't tell me you're finding the  - Harems more compelling than killing  - demons? That would be out of  - character for one such as yourself. - 
 getLocaleString(388)	63 - I am certain that you will find the  - information you need when you find  - Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it  - quickly, for Diablo may be getting  - closer to freeing his brother as we  - speak. - 
 getLocaleString(389)	68 - Huh? The horizon is always out of  - reach, you should know that. Oh,  - Horazon! Oh, I see. Uh. -   - Yes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes,  - but... total lunatic. - 
 getLocaleString(390)	57 - Even a sanctuary such as Horazon's  - can be breached by the tentacles of  - Evil. Such a haven could have become a  - chamber of unspeakable horrors. Be  - wary of what you may unleash! - 
 getLocaleString(391)	49 - All my years of brawling, of pummeling  - both the unsuspecting and the  - deserving, have yielded two insights.  - You can either fight or you can run. All  - other strategies are variations of  - these. - 
 getLocaleString(392)	77 - So... Now that you're such a pal of  - Jerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can  - set sail one of these days? I'm running  - out of patience. - 
 getLocaleString(393)	87 - So you've been in the palace, have you?  - Tell me, why does Jerhyn keep that  - place locked up so tight? - 
 getLocaleString(394)	87 - Fate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt  - you with dung if you mock it. - 
 getLocaleString(395)	51 - I've been thinking about the problems in  - Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has  - occurred to you as well... -   - If those cellar passageways lead to the  - Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where  - the demons came from. Horazon's  - haven must have been breached! - 
 getLocaleString(396)	37 - Seekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will  - find it through the Portal. But know  - that the glowing glyphs recorded here  - in my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs  - of the six False Tombs. -   - The missing Seventh Sign marks the  - Tomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim  - he might be called the foremost. -   - It was a shining - but brief - moment for  - the Mage Clans when they set aside  - their differences and worked together  - against the common enemy. -   - The Horadrim relentlessly pursued the  - Three across the desolate Empires of  - the East, and even into the uncharted  - lands of the West, leaving the  - Archangel Tyrael's hands unblemished. -   - Presuming the Three to be vanquished,  - the Horadrim's unstable fellowship  - began to dissipate. Abandoning their  - sacred charge to safeguard the three  - Soulstones, the disparate Mage Clans  - began to squabble amongst each other  - over petty differences. -   - Their conflicts not only dissolved their  - brotherhood, but strengthened the  - Evils which they had buried beneath the  - cold earth. - 
 getLocaleString(397)	59 - Unbelievable! The Harem girls are dead!  - The palace guards have been fighting  - off demons from the cellar. How could  - that happen without my knowledge? - 
 getLocaleString(398)	62 - I thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also  - glad that you found something you  - were looking for. The journal should  - help you find the True Tomb of Tal  - Rasha. Hopefully, there is still time to  - get there before Diablo. -   - Go now. And good luck. - 
 getLocaleString(399)	55 - You have found Horazon's Journal.  - Excellent... But, I must caution you. -   - The mark of the True Tomb of Tal  - Rasha, is sought, if not already known,  - by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the  - implications of that. - 
 getLocaleString(400)	71 - News of the tragedy in the palace is  - spreading fast. How awful! And to  - think, this whole time I thought Jerhyn  - and his guards were in there playing  - with the harem girls. - 
 getLocaleString(401)	60 - Hah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the  - palace. I would've saved those girls and  - kicked demon ass back to the fire-pits  - o' Hell! - 
 getLocaleString(402)	52 - So... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret.  - Well... I guess I can see why he wanted  - me to stay, though... I'm just glad it  - didn't come to that. Now he tells me to  - wait some more, in case you need to  - get out of here. -   - Well, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll  - mention me in the epic ballads, eh? - 
 getLocaleString(403)	67 - Well, the news going around town is  - very unsettling. Apparently, we were in  - more danger than anyone thought. -   - Good work friend... you may have saved  - all our skins. - 
 getLocaleString(404)	64 - Faith is stronger than any armor. The  - shield will protect the body, but Faith  - will strengthen the courageous heart. - 
 getLocaleString(405)	55 - Horazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes,  - well... Glad you found it. Such a shame  - about those poor harem girls, huh? I  - shall miss them deeply... I mean their  - conversations, of course. - 
 getLocaleString(406)	62 - Oh, those poor women! Will the  - slaughter never end? Thank you once  - again for protecting our city. - 
 getLocaleString(407)	57 - You must move quickly now, friend, for  - Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding  - what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal  - Rasha before he frees the Lord of  - Destruction. - 
 getLocaleString(408)	89 - That guy really talks like that? Sounds  - like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy  - or that's some impostor. - 
 getLocaleString(409)	57 - The man you describe is probably not  - Horazon. -   - He sounds like the very mage who came  - around here a while ago. He was very  - curious about this palace and seemed  - especially interested in the seal on the  - passageway in the cellar. He left  - shortly after that. I wonder how he got  - down there? The seal was never  - broken... -   - That mage spoke a great deal to  - Drognan. Why don't you ask him about  - it? - 
 getLocaleString(410)	47 - Yes... The man you speak of sounds like  - the mage who came here many months  - ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo  - in the passages beneath Tristram. -   - No doubt the fool wandered into  - Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever  - was left of his ravaged mind. He is  - beyond salvation.  -   - It is possible that the fool has been  - possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If  - that's true, then you'd better put an  - end to his tortured existence. -   - Once done, I believe the demons who  - were summoned and imprisoned within  - the Sanctuary will cease to exist as  - well. - 
 getLocaleString(411)	57 - Ah, yes. I remember. There was a...  - fellow around here many months ago  - who asked almost as many questions  - about Horazon as you. -   - So... He discovered enough to assume  - Horazon's place in the Arcane  - Sanctuary, huh? What a fool! - 
 getLocaleString(412)	72 - Ah, yes. As a ship captain I am well  - aware of the phenomenon of a false  - Horazon. -   - Sorry, just a little joke. - 
 getLocaleString(413)	99 - There's nothing more dreadful than a  - powerful being driven by a frayed  - mind. - 
 getLocaleString(414)	105 - You always seem to find the worst  - trouble. I don't know how you handle it. - 
 getLocaleString(415)	38 - So! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be  - surprised if he wasn't. All those  - centuries without ale would drive  - anyone to drink... but then you couldn't  - drink. And that would drive you to  - drink... Hah?... What was the question? - 
 getLocaleString(416)	63 - Hmmm... That doesn't sound like  - Horazon. I'll agree that he may have  - gone mad, but from what you tell me, I  - don't think that's the case. Talk to  - Drognan... he may know more than I. - 
 getLocaleString(417)	106 - Ugh... Crazy mages give me the creeps. -   - Just kill him and get on with your  - business. - 
 getLocaleString(418)	45 - The appearance of the mage you  - describe sounds like one I met back in  - Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight  - against Diablo, the Lord of Terror.  - Perhaps, this is one of them. -   - You know, fate seems to have frowned  - upon all of the heroes who confronted  - that terrible Evil. Take care or the  - same may happen to you. - 
 getLocaleString(419)	76 - So, Horazon's been dead for some time.  - I take it you at least found what you  - were looking for. - 
 getLocaleString(420)	60 - The way I see it... Well, it's all pretty  - blurry. - 
 getLocaleString(421)	63 - The demonic force that was emanating  - from the corrupted Sanctuary has  - dissipated. I thank you greatly for your  - help. Now, we can look to rebuilding  - our lives. -   - All will be for nothing, though, if you do  - not stop the greater Evil which is  - rapidly gaining ground. - 
 getLocaleString(422)	83 - Larger forces are moving inexorably  - towards us. You must now make haste  - to the Tombs. - 
 getLocaleString(423)	65 - You make me long for the days of glory.  - When I had both hands, both eyes and  - more of a foot... - 
 getLocaleString(424)	84 - I guess you'll be heading to the Tombs  - now? I hear that they're in the deepest  - desert regions. - 
 getLocaleString(425)	100 - Well! You've got what you're after. Now  - get a move on before it's too late. - 
 getLocaleString(426)	103 - Huhhh... Such is always the fate of  - those who meddle with evil. - 
 getLocaleString(427)	89 - You're more the hero than I could have  - dreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us  - after all. - 
 getLocaleString(428)	74 - I feel no pity for that would-be  - Summoner. His terrible ambition for  - demonic power was his undoing. You  - merely hastened the inevitable. - 
 getLocaleString(429)	48 - I hope that this false Summoner found  - peace in death. Unfortunately, it is  - more likely that he will be dragged  - down into Hell by the demons he was  - bound to. -   - Let this be a lesson to you... Demonic  - magic is a quick path, but its powers  - are seductive and deadly. - 
 getLocaleString(430)	45 - I have heard of your many deeds of skill  - and bravery. I feel I can trust you with  - something I have been hesitant to  - speak of... -   - Drognan and I have concluded that the  - Dark Wanderer who passed through  - here recently was Diablo, himself!  - Drognan believes that Diablo is  - searching the desert for the secret  - tomb where the great Horadric mage,  - Tal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned. -   - You must find Diablo and put an end to  - the terrible evil that has fallen upon  - our city. Drognan is wise and is sure to  - have some helpful advice for you as to  - how Tal Rasha's tomb may be found. -   - It may take you quite some time to find  - The Tomb. May you be ready when you  - do. - 
 getLocaleString(431)	53 - It is well-known that there are seven  - great Horadric tombs hidden beneath  - the sands in the furthest reaches of  - the desert. One of them surely must be  - Tal Rasha's prison. You must explore  - each of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's  - exact location. -   - Of course, Diablo is searching for the  - Tomb as well... No one can guess as to  - what terrors he has unleashed in his  - search. - 
 getLocaleString(432)	59 - So... You're going to search for the  - Seven Tombs, huh? Don't you know  - that they're just desert legends passed  - between merchants and travelers? No  - one really believes that they exist. - 
 getLocaleString(433)	61 - Be very careful, my friend. I think I've  - seen enough recently not to doubt that  - these Tombs exist. And if they do,  - they're most certainly guarded by  - terrible creatures. - 
 getLocaleString(434)	67 - I've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal  - Rasha, but I thought they were just old  - tales meant to scare young children. - 
 getLocaleString(435)	59 - Ohh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs...  - But... umm... I don't like all that living  - dead stuff. - 
 getLocaleString(436)	84 - I'm sorry, I can't help you much here.  - Now, if the tombs were across the  - ocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to. - 
 getLocaleString(437)	57 - Legend has it that Tal Rasha lies  - imprisoned within his tomb, forever  - struggling to keep the Lord of  - Destruction bound. His was a selfless  - act, although perhaps foolhardy. - 
 getLocaleString(438)	56 - When Tal Rasha chose to embody the  - spirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to  - wrestle eternally against the will of the  - greater Evil. Look around you and ask  - yourself, 'Has the battle been won or  - lost?' - 
 getLocaleString(439)	55 - Tal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the  - desert among six others. Tal Rasha's  - symbol marks the True Tomb. If you  - want to know what that symbol is, you  - should be able to find it within the  - legendary Arcane Sanctuary. - 
 getLocaleString(440)	57 - Diablo nears his goal. We have little  - time to lose. -   - Remember, my friend, that Andariel  - gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause.  - It would be prudent to assume that the  - other Evils will attempt to aid their  - master as well. - 
 getLocaleString(441)	106 - If you're going into the deep desert, why  - not hire a few of my men to watch your  - back? - 
 getLocaleString(442)	47 - You have done very well. Few could have  - come this far, let alone discover the  - True Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately,  - I hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded  - your grasp. This is most unfortunate... -   - If you wish to travel East, I have  - authorized Meshif to give you passage  - by sea. I imagine he should be very  - anxious to leave by now. -   - Good luck on your quest, and thank you  - again for saving my beloved city. You  - will always be welcome in Lut Gholein,  - my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(443)	71 - I heard that Diablo has managed to  - best you, at least for the time being. I  - hope you catch up with him soon, and  - send him back to Hell for good! - 
 getLocaleString(444)	70 - I'm sorry things didn't turn out as you  - had hoped. Go and remember us  - fondly. You know, you bothered me far  - less than most. - 
 getLocaleString(445)	64 - You have proven to be the greatest of  - heroes, and I am honored to call you  - friend. Thank you for bringing peace to  - our lives again. - 
 getLocaleString(446)	68 - Never fear, my friend. You did the best  - you could. -   - I suspect that Diablo and Baal are now  - heading east, towards Kurast. You'll  - find them... I know you will. - 
 getLocaleString(447)	46 - This is terrible news! Baal is in  - possession of one of mankind's most  - powerful mages, and the Lord of Terror  - guides his path. They must be stopped,  - for I am sure they mean to free their  - elder brother Mephisto, the Lord of  - Hatred, who lies imprisoned under the  - corrupted city of Kurast. -   - I fear you are walking into a great evil,  - but your faith can save you. May you  - walk in the light always. - 
 getLocaleString(448)	54 - You're an inspiration! And such a hero  - that it makes me look twice as bad... -   - Ahh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some  - glory for us little guys, huh? - 
 getLocaleString(449)	51 - This is a serious setback... It is most  - unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been  - consumed by Baal's destructive  - influence. There are many secrets  - known to the Horadrim, which could be  - used by Baal against us. -   - You must travel east by sea to Kurast  - and stop Diablo and Baal before they  - free their eldest brother, Mephisto. -   - Hahh... The lands of the eastern Empire  - are not the same as they used to be.  - There has been little word for some  - time. -   - Speed is of the essence. Go quickly, my  - friend. May the fates smile on you. - 
 getLocaleString(450)	82 - Jerhyn tells me I should take you east to  - Kurast. I haven't been there for several  - years, but rumor has it that things are  - pretty grim. - 
 getLocaleString(451)	51 - I've heard that your foe got away from  - you this time. Well, look at it this way...  - you've got the demons on the run. If  - you're going to be leaving, then... Well,  - thanks for your help. - 
 getLocaleString(452)	39 - The Archangel Tyrael was the one who  - gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim  - two hundred and sixty years ago. -   - It is highly unusual for the forces of  - Heaven to so directly interfere with  - man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to  - act of his own volition. We have never  - been able to discern why. -   - Perhaps, he goes against the consensus  - of Heaven because he doubts our  - ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps,  - he sees more threat than his peers. -   - Where the actions of Hell often seem  - straightforwardly bent on destruction,  - the motives of Heaven are  - unfathomable. -   - Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal  - must be stopped before they join with  - their brother, Mephisto. If the three  - Prime Evils unite once again, the world  - as we know it will be no more. - 
 getLocaleString(453)	48 - Greetings, hero. I've heard of your  - exploits and... I'm quite impressed.  - Very few mortals are capable of  - dealing with the Three and their  - minions as you have. -   - My name is Natalya. I am a hunter of  - Evil, part of an ancient Order sworn to  - hunt down corrupted sorcerers. -   - If I could, I would gladly join your quest  - to stop the Three. But I must wait here  - for further news. I can't predict what  - will happen, but the danger is greater  - than we can know. -   - Until I receive my orders, I'll assist you  - with the information I have. - 
 getLocaleString(454)	74 - Asheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking  - mage, but I'd wager she's never faced  - true Evil. -   - Pampering drunken mercenaries is one  - thing, but standing face to face with a  - hell-spawned demon is another. - 
 getLocaleString(455)	69 - I've heard the name of Deckard Cain  - many times. He's the last of the  - Horadrim, and thus, I must honor him.  - You must be powerful, indeed, if one  - such as he accompanies you. - 
 getLocaleString(456)	100 - Hratli is a master craftsman. My Order  - could make use of one with his unique  - skills. - 
 getLocaleString(457)	67 - My Order has been keeping watch over  - Ormus for many years, now. He seems  - to champion the cause of good, but  - who knows what shadow lurks within  - his soul? - 
 getLocaleString(458)	45 - I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for  - many years. But I never would have  - imagined it could be so corrupted. -   - Certainly, this must be Mephisto's work!  - You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo  - and Baal are still out there and you  - must find them. - 
 getLocaleString(459)	62 - Seeing his homeland in such a state  - must be horrifying to Meshif. I'm  - surprised he's willing to remain here in  - order to help you. - 
 getLocaleString(460)	82 - Asheara seems like a very tough  - woman. I'd be careful around her if I  - were you. - 
 getLocaleString(461)	53 - Drognan told me of Hratli when we were  - in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves  - magic into his forge and produces  - mystical weapons and armor. -   - His skills could be quite useful to you.  - 
 getLocaleString(462)	44 - Judging from his dress and strange  - markings, I would guess that Ormus is  - from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet  - none of the others here seem to know  - that he is a sorcerer. -   - The Taan were once as powerful as the  - Vizjerei clan, but their studies were  - even more secretive. I wonder what  - he's hiding. - 
 getLocaleString(463)	49 - Have you met, Natalya? She appears to  - be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a  - secret order that has been around for  - centuries... almost as long as the  - Horadrim, itself. -   - Her presence here makes me uneasy,  - for they are traditionally sworn to hunt  - down Magi who have betrayed the trust  - of their order. -   - I wonder why she is here. - 
 getLocaleString(464)	73 - Ormus would like you to think him mad.  - Better to watch his actions than listen  - to his words. - 
 getLocaleString(465)	33 - Welcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come  - willingly to this ancient city anymore. I  - hope you brought your wits with you,  - for sanity is in short supply here. -   - My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer  - skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure  - to help you... I don't have many  - customers these days. -   - As you can see, the populace has been  - brutally decimated by the forces of  - Mephisto. The canals run red with  - blood and demons roam the land. -   - The wretched jungle-hell has already  - reclaimed much of Kurast. The only  - safety you'll find is here at the  - dockside, where a magical warding  - holds the jungle evils at bay... but I  - don't know how long it will last. -   - To make matters worse, the Children of  - Zakarum are in league with the forces  - of Mephisto. The Zakarum have  - concentrated their power in the Temple  - City of Travincal, located within Kurast  - deep in the jungle wilderness. -   - It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I  - say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are  - nothing more than the twisted puppets  - of a hidden hand. - 
 getLocaleString(466)	33 - Welcome to Kurast, young Sorceress.  - Few come willingly to this ancient city  - anymore. I hope you brought your wits  - with you, for sanity is in short supply  - here. -   - My name is Hratli. I am a sorcerer  - skilled in metal work. It'd be a pleasure  - to help you... I don't have many  - customers these days. -   - Though my own magic is only useful for  - making enchanted weapons, I'll bet  - yours will put an end to this terrible  - evil once and for all. May the spirits of  - Skatsim watch over and protect you. -   - As you can see, the populace has been  - brutally decimated by the forces of  - Mephisto. The canals run red with  - blood and demons roam the land. -   - The wretched jungle-hell has already  - reclaimed much of Kurast. The only  - safety you'll find is here at the  - dockside, where a magical warding  - holds the jungle evils at bay... but I  - don't know how long it will last. -   - To make matters worse, the Children of  - Zakarum are in league with the forces  - of Mephisto. The Zakarum have  - concentrated their power in the Temple  - City of Travincal, located within Kurast  - deep in the jungle wilderness. -   - It's true... Their zeal is unmatched. But I  - say the so-called 'Warriors of Light' are  - nothing more than the twisted puppets  - of a hidden hand. - 
 getLocaleString(467)	48 - You're very brave to have come here. In  - the old days, mages who didn't belong  - to one of the great Mage Clans were  - hunted down as renegades. But now,  - the Mage Clans have little authority. - 
 getLocaleString(468)	53 - Within the Temple City stands a tower  - built long ago by the Horadrim to  - imprison the... Well, you'll discover  - more about it soon enough. - 
 getLocaleString(469)	60 - If you are another follower of Zakarum,  - I've told you people before I don't want  - your Towering Spire or anything else  - you have to sell! - 
 getLocaleString(470)	74 - Some find my prices unreasonable. That  - is because I am unreasonable. - 
 getLocaleString(471)	76 - You'll find that the Zakarumites have  - the persistence of zombies, but without  - the charisma. - 
 getLocaleString(472)	60 - Asheara leads the mercenary company  - known as the Iron Wolves. You can hire  - some of them, but many are occupied  - securing the dockside. - 
 getLocaleString(473)	74 - Alkor is a potion dealer given over to a  - life steeped in ceaseless study and  - dissipation. - 
 getLocaleString(474)	58 - Ormus is a man of many mysteries. I  - sense strong magic about him, but he's  - never spoken of it to me. - 
 getLocaleString(475)	49 - I trust you already know Meshif. But did  - you know that he was born and raised  - here? -   - I suspect that like many of us his spirit  - is near broken at the sight of Kurast's  - decline. Only our brand of gallows  - humor saves us from utter despair. - 
 getLocaleString(476)	55 - This, Cain, whom you brought with you.  - He has the bearing of great power, yet  - I sense no magic about him. He is an  - enigma to me. - 
 getLocaleString(477)	49 - Natalya is a quiet one. She arrived here  - about a week ago and has pretty much  - kept to herself. She's inquired about  - my weapons a few times, so I assume  - that she's a warrior of some sort. - 
 getLocaleString(478)	51 - Well, I gave you my word, and brought  - you here as promised. -   - But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd  - never returned to this accursed place.  - This fetid jungle can't be the fair  - Kurast I left behind. -   - I don't know what all this evil is, my  - friend, but it's obvious that you must  - stop it. I only pray that you can before  - the jungle consumes the last vestiges  - of my beloved homeland. - 
 getLocaleString(479)	47 - Being a Barbarian, I'm sure you've seen  - many strange sights in the northlands. -   - But by all that's still holy, I wish I'd  - never returned to this accursed place.  - This fetid jungle can't be the fair  - Kurast I left behind! -   - I don't know what all this evil is, my  - friend, but it's obvious that you must  - stop it. I only pray that you can before  - the jungle consumes the last vestiges  - of my beloved homeland. -   - If this evil isn't contained, it could  - spread north to your homeland, too.  - Then the whole world would fall under  - the shadow of the Three. - 
 getLocaleString(480)	63 - It takes great courage and generosity  - to defend a land and a people that are  - not your own. Perhaps, when this curse  - is lifted, my people can do something  - for yours in return. - 
 getLocaleString(481)	72 - I shouldn't have boasted so much about  - Kurast on the journey here. Oh... Much  - has changed since I left. - 
 getLocaleString(482)	99 - The dockside is apparently the only  - civilized area left in Kurast. - 
 getLocaleString(483)	88 - If you are planning to carry on your  - wild ways here, you may need the  - assistance of Asheara's Iron Wolf  - mercenaries. - 
 getLocaleString(484)	75 - Your companion, Cain, must have  - known that he would be in grave  - danger here. You are great, indeed, to  - elicit such loyalty. - 
 getLocaleString(485)	81 - Hratli seems to be the only one left here  - with any common sense. Yet how  - sensible is it to remain here? - 
 getLocaleString(486)	80 - I went to speak with old Alkor, but I  - disturbed his studies. He doesn't seem  - to like visitors. - 
 getLocaleString(487)	73 - Trying to get information out of Ormus  - is like straining water from a rock. His  - damned riddles are almost as  - confusing as our current state of  - affairs. - 
 getLocaleString(488)	75 - That woman, Natalya, seems to be  - waiting for something important to  - happen. She's a strange one, I think. - 
 getLocaleString(489)	68 - All through my childhood, Kurast was a  - paradise. The once perfumed air now  - reeks of putrefaction. - 
 getLocaleString(490)	54 - Hello, there. You must be a great  - adventurer to risk coming here. -   - My name's Asheara, and I lead the  - mercenary band of mages known as  - the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting  - down demons in the jungle for months,  - but no matter how many of them we  - kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this  - whole place has been overrun by evil. -   - Rumor has it that you've come here to  - help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire  - some of my mercenaries. -   - But be careful... If you piss them off,  - they can be worse than those monsters  - out in the jungle. - 
 getLocaleString(491)	50 - Hello, there. You must be an Amazon.  - I've heard about your people... nomadic  - warriors without peer. -   - My name's Asheara, and I lead the  - mercenary band of mages known as  - the Iron Wolves. We've been hunting  - down demons in the jungle for months,  - but no matter how many of them we  - kill, they just keep comin'. Seems this  - whole place has been overrun by evil. -   - Rumor has it that you've come here to  - help. If that's true, then I'll let you hire  - some of my mercenaries. -   - But be careful... If you piss them off,  - they can be worse than those monsters  - out in the jungle. - 
 getLocaleString(492)	66 - Your skills are unique indeed. They are  - neither sorcery, nor physical, but seem  - to be a harmonious blend of the two.  - The Iron Wolves could learn much from  - your kind. - 
 getLocaleString(493)	160 - Why fight fair, when you can hire some  - of us? - 
 getLocaleString(494)	107 - No one comes to Kurast anymore  - without good reason.  You must be  - seeking fame and fortune. - 
 getLocaleString(495)	137 - The Iron Wolves and I have made a  - good living around here lately. - 
 getLocaleString(496)	110 - The jungle can take you down fast. Try  - to avoid getting trapped out there if  - you can. - 
 getLocaleString(497)	90 - Hratli may be a bit too clever for his  - own good. Still, I'd trust his work  - anytime. - 
 getLocaleString(498)	77 - Hratli thinks he's so funny. The other  - day he said, 'Asheara, I don't recognize  - you without that big gash on your  - face.' - 
 getLocaleString(499)	97 - Meshif says he used to live here. I'm  - surprised he came back. I'll bet he  - wishes he hadn't. - 
 getLocaleString(500)	78 - I invited Natalya to join the Iron Wolves  - and she began lecturing me about the  - 'dangers of magic'. Who the hell does  - she think she is, anyway? - 
 getLocaleString(501)	61 - Damn it, I wish you people would just  - leave me alone! I... -   - Oh, you're new here, aren't you? -   - I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in  - potions and salves, and I can sell you  - some if you really need them. -   - But don't make a habit of coming here. I  - don't like to be disturbed while I'm  - studying! - 
 getLocaleString(502)	48 - Damn it, I wish you people would just  - leave me alone! I... -   - Oh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you?  - I've heard that your kind use powerful  - potions and such to wake the dead and  - control spirits. I'd love to discuss what  - components you use some time. -   - I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in  - potions and salves, myself, and I can  - sell you some if you really need them. -   - ...Feel free to drop by anytime. - 
 getLocaleString(503)	55 - Even I can tell that the evil in the jungle  - is growing. I hope you survive out  - there, my pasty friend. I'd still like to  - discuss what components are best  - used in necromantic potions. - 
 getLocaleString(504)	151 - Care to take a gander at my Grimoire? - 
 getLocaleString(505)	90 - I've never claimed that you'd live forever  - after trying one of my potions! Merely  - that you might look as though you had. - 
 getLocaleString(506)	105 - I keep a library of tomes - heretical,  - exegetical, hermeneutical and  - pharmaceutical. - 
 getLocaleString(507)	50 - There was a very fat man here recently  - asking after the Golden Bird of Ku  - Y'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept  - muttering about ashes. I would imagine  - one Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about  - the same as another, wouldn't you? - 
 getLocaleString(508)	150 - I hope you don't object to my badgering  - the witless. - 
 getLocaleString(509)	115 - You came here with Meshif? That old  - 'tour-guide to the stupid'! -   - I'm surprised you made it here in one  - piece. - 
 getLocaleString(510)	98 - Oh, Asheara's a good customer. She  - buys a potion of manliness from me  - every week. - 
 getLocaleString(511)	82 - Hratli's only good for making his silly  - magic weapons. It's not like he's got  - the stones to actually go out and use  - them on anything. - 
 getLocaleString(512)	88 - Oh, Ormus has been talking in riddles  - for years. I think he does it to cover up  - the fact that he's got nothing  - intelligent to say. - 
 getLocaleString(513)	52 - Yes, Natalya is a cute girl. However, I  - think she could use a special potion. -   - Let me see here, 'Radiant Beauty'... No.  - 'Ray of Sunshine'... No, that's not it. -   - Ah, here it is: 'Relax Frosty Bitch'. This  - should help her out. - 
 getLocaleString(514)	38 - You now speak to Ormus. -   - He was once a great mage, but now  - lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You  - have questions for Ormus and doubt in  - yourself. Ormus sees a strange  - dichotomy in you... as he does in all  - would-be heroes. -   - Speak to him and he may grant you  - wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and  - seek wisdom in thyself. - 
 getLocaleString(515)	37 - You now speak to Ormus, good Paladin. -   - He was once a great mage, but now  - lives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You  - have questions for Ormus and doubt in  - yourself. Ormus sees a strange  - dichotomy in you... as he does in all  - would-be heroes. -   - Speak to him and he may grant you  - wisdom in turn. Or turn from him and  - seek wisdom in thyself. - 
 getLocaleString(516)	68 - The Church which you serve is  - corrupted by evil. Yet the holy  - disciplines it taught you may yet save  - us all. -   - This is a strange time for heroes,  - Ormus thinks. - 
 getLocaleString(517)	65 - Your salvation can only be reached  - through Hatred. A strange fate, but a  - true one. - 
 getLocaleString(518)	52 - How does one destroy Destruction? How  - does one force Terror to flee in fear?  - You have great tasks ahead of you,  - Ormus thinks. - 
 getLocaleString(519)	72 - The Church of Light harbors the darkest  - shadow of all. Tread lightly. - 
 getLocaleString(520)	89 - When speaking of the dead, it is best to  - remain cryptic. - 
 getLocaleString(521)	84 - The Travincal can be breached by the  - loss of one's wits, not by the use of  - them. - 
 getLocaleString(522)	95 - Alkor is able to explain things much  - more clearly than Ormus. - 
 getLocaleString(523)	58 - For one who spends so much time away  - from home, Meshif has taken Kurast's  - corruption the hardest. - 
 getLocaleString(524)	91 - Asheara is both proud and  - self-conscious of her womanhood. - 
 getLocaleString(525)	65 - Deckard Cain... Ormus has no time for  - the last son of the Horadrim. Pride led  - that holy Order to failure. - 
 getLocaleString(526)	63 - Hratli suspects that Ormus is a mage.  - He can suspect whatever he wants,  - Ormus will not show him the true  - magic. - 
 getLocaleString(527)	53 - Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he  - had a fondness for jade figurines. On  - his trading voyages he collected an odd  - assortment of such small statues. -   - I would show him your figurine.  - 
 getLocaleString(528)	160 - Only Deckard Cain can make sense of  - this. - 
 getLocaleString(529)	73 - Praise you! That jade figurine will  - complete the set I was collecting. -   - Here! I've had this statuette of a golden  - bird for years, but I consider it a fair  - exchange. - 
 getLocaleString(530)	89 - I'm having fun just watching you run  - from place to place searching for a  - Golden Bird. Some hero you are. - 
 getLocaleString(531)	47 - I've read legends about a sage named  - Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of  - life beyond death. -   - If I remember correctly, his ashes were  - ensconced within a golden statuette. It  - was a very strange tale. - 
 getLocaleString(532)	134 - You will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to  - Alkor. - 
 getLocaleString(533)	96 - Such a beautiful statuette... But, you'd  - think it would've been better cared for.  - There's a compartment here that's full  - o' dust. - 
 getLocaleString(534)	73 - Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank  - you, my friend.  -   - Busy yourself while I experiment with  - the ashes within it. Then, return and  - see what I have made for you. - 
 getLocaleString(535)	51 - Ku Y'leh, in searching for immortal  - youth, found only an early death. His  - apprentices, seeking to live forever,  - burned his body in order to derive  - benefit from his ashes. - 
 getLocaleString(536)	50 - Ku Y'leh was a powerful sage who was  - rumored to have brewed a potion of  - immortality. In an ironic twist of fate,  - he was murdered before his potent  - elixir could take effect. - 
 getLocaleString(537)	78 - Don't tell me you believe in all of that  - 'life after death' nonsense. You should  - be more concerned with avoiding death  - than making plans for after it finds  - you. - 
 getLocaleString(538)	120 - From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed  - for you a potion. - 
 getLocaleString(539)	94 - Immortality is definitely not for me. -   - Can you imagine having to wake up  - every night just to piss for the next  - thousand years? - 
 getLocaleString(540)	63 - So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all  - along. I wonder if he knows what he  - gave up for that jade figurine. - 
 getLocaleString(541)	54 - Ormus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh.  - That venerable sage forgot that there  - is no life beyond death. There is only  - life. -   - Once prolonged unnaturally, it can  - become a living hell. - 
 getLocaleString(542)	67 - I must admit, your foolish quest made  - little sense to me. But now I see the  - value of your actions. I believe you do  - possess great wisdom. - 
 getLocaleString(543)	33 - Never forget that your ultimate purpose  - here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto.  - The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the  - Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian  - Tower that is located within the Temple  - City of Travincal. -   - Know this, friend. The only way to gain  - entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy  - the artifact known as the Compelling  - Orb. -   - Mephisto used this device to control the  - Zakarum Priests and their followers.  - The Orb can only be destroyed with an  - ancient flail imbued with the spirit of  - the one incorruptible priest. -   - Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto  - worked his evil corruption on the  - Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to  - his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the  - Que-Hegan of the High Council. -   - Mephisto directed the other Council  - priests to slay and dismember Khalim  - and then scatter his remains across  - the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur  - succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan,  - eventually becoming the embodiment of  - Mephisto here on the mortal plane. -   - The corrupted High Council fashioned  - an Orb to control the rest of the  - Zakarum faithful and used their powers  - to hide the lair of their master from  - mortals. -   - Your task is to collect the scattered  - relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain,  - and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric  - Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his  - relics. -   - Once this is accomplished, you must  - destroy the Compelling Orb with  - Khalim's Will to open the way into the  - corrupt sanctum of Mephisto. - 
 getLocaleString(544)	61 - You have found Khalim's Heart, and it  - still bears the courage to face  - Mephisto! -   - Place it in the Horadric Cube along with  - Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the  - Brain, and the Flail. - 
 getLocaleString(545)	52 - Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal  - the true path to Mephisto. -   - Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube  - along with Khalim's other relics - the  - Heart, the Brain, and the Flail. - 
 getLocaleString(546)	58 - This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain  - knows Mephisto's weakness. -   - Place it in the Horadric Cube along with  - Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the  - Heart, and the Flail. - 
 getLocaleString(547)	46 - Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can  - destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal  - the way to Mephisto. -   - Place it into the Horadric Cube along  - with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his  - Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute  - them to carry out Khalim's Will. - 
 getLocaleString(548)	54 - Masterfully done, hero! You have  - crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to  - destroy the Compelling Orb and open  - the way to Mephisto.  -   - May the true Light guide your way. - 
 getLocaleString(549)	56 - It pains me to waste time with you, so  - I'll get right to the point. -   - There is a very special book which you  - must find for me. It was written long  - ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who  - studied Skatsimi magic and the effects  - of the Prime Evils on the mortal world.  - The Black Book was lost when the  - Children of Zakarum took over this  - land. -   - Now, you must reclaim it without delay!  - Its knowledge may aid us in this dark  - time ahead. - 
 getLocaleString(550)	73 - The Black Book contains powerful  - secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion,  - long eclipsed by Zakarum. -   - I should warn you. The Black Book is  - much sought after by both good and  - evil. Be wary. - 
 getLocaleString(551)	62 - The Children of Zakarum believe that  - the Black Book is filled with  - blasphemous heresy. In truth, the book  - may contain the secrets to our ultimate  - redemption. - 
 getLocaleString(552)	73 - Oh. No one really believes that the Black  - Book exists. It's just a symbol of  - Zakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda. - 
 getLocaleString(553)	102 - Many things can be found in the city of  - Kurast. The book may be there. - 
 getLocaleString(554)	54 - We have long sought the Black Book of  - Lam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts  - spread as fast as jungle plagues. If you  - find it, take it to Alkor. - 
 getLocaleString(555)	72 - The Black Book is a powerful source of  - information. The Zakarum will do  - everything in their power to stop you  - from obtaining it. - 
 getLocaleString(556)	81 - I've heard of the Black Book. My Order's  - code is based on many of its passages.  - If you find it, I will be greatly  - impressed. - 
 getLocaleString(557)	104 - Did I neglect to mention that the book  - contains useful information about the  - Prime Evils? - 
 getLocaleString(558)	55 - Even if you find the sacred Book, you  - must still traverse the jungle of  - meaning within it. That journey could  - prove to be far more perilous. - 
 getLocaleString(559)	56 - Kurast was once the greatest city in the  - world. Now it is hard to tell where the  - jungle stops and the city begins. The  - jungle grows rampant on the soil  - enriched by the blood of my fellow  - citizens. - 
 getLocaleString(560)	68 - I believe I can trust you now. -   - When you first arrived, I suspected you  - a spy for the Zakarum, the false  - religion whose faithful are now under  - the sway of a mysterious power.  - They've made a mockery of the Old  - Religion of Skatsim. - 
 getLocaleString(561)	62 - Not getting much help? -   - You know, people are like rugs. Hang  - them out a window and shake 'em a  - couple times. You'll be surprised how  - much dirt comes out. - 
 getLocaleString(562)	81 - I heard that there are ruined temples in  - Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black  - Book in one of them. - 
 getLocaleString(563)	105 - I hope you find the Black Book soon. I  - could use something to read while I  - wait for my orders. - 
 getLocaleString(564)	83 - You have found the Book! It should give  - all of us here some insight into the  - nature of the Prime Evils... -   - Ah, but as for you... - 
 getLocaleString(565)	70 - Why is the Black Book of Lam Esen like  - a coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape  - of our future. - 
 getLocaleString(566)	75 - Thank all that's holy. You've returned  - with the Black Book! Maybe now you  - can put an end to the Evil that has  - destroyed my homeland. - 
 getLocaleString(567)	135 - The Iron Wolves are very impressed by  - your skills. - 
 getLocaleString(568)	74 - We have the Book. Now we must see if  - we can bear its revelations. - 
 getLocaleString(569)	86 - You have found a source of information  - powerful enough to turn the tide  - against the Zakarum. - 
 getLocaleString(570)	89 - So, you've returned with the Book. You  - surprise me. You must be very  - resourceful. - 
 getLocaleString(571)	45 - As I told you before, I placed an  - enchantment upon the dockside in  - order to keep the demons at bay. But  - lately, the enchantment seems to be  - weakening. -   - If memory serves me correctly, there is  - a holy Skatsimi blade that could  - revitalize the enchantment. The blade  - is called the Gidbinn. -   - Find it, and our sanctuary here will  - remain safe. - 
 getLocaleString(572)	66 - Have you not heard of the Gidbinn?  - Well, allow me to reduce your  - ignorance on the subject. -   - The Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a  - religious artifact greatly valued by the  - Old Religion, Skatsim. - 
 getLocaleString(573)	64 - Ormus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But  - how would a powerful Skatsimi artifact  - aid an unbeliever like you? - 
 getLocaleString(574)	66 - The Gidbinn is one of the few remaining  - relics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is  - reputed to have great powers. - 
 getLocaleString(575)	107 - The Gidbinn will reinforce the  - enchantments that protect the  - dockside from the evil that infests  - Kurast. - 
 getLocaleString(576)	54 - As far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the  - possession of the Children of Light.  - They do not wish it to fall into the  - hands of those who can restore its  - powers. -   - You may not believe it, but Ormus is the  - one who can use the Gidbinn to protect  - us. - 
 getLocaleString(577)	55 - I've done some research on the Taan  - mage-clan, and it seems that most of  - their magical studies were focused on  - Skatsimi rites. -   - If anyone is qualified to use the powers  - of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus. - 
 getLocaleString(578)	73 - Don't let the Gidbinn's size fool you.  - Though it is only a small dagger, it  - holds tremendous power when in the  - hands of a true Skatsimi mage. - 
 getLocaleString(579)	70 - Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests  - placed great power within the small  - blade. Power enough to repel this  - terrible jungle-curse which encroaches  - on our sanctuary. - 
 getLocaleString(580)	83 - If we are to have peace from the  - shadow, you must find the weapon  - which will destroy the Light. - 
 getLocaleString(581)	67 - The jungle is like nothing you've ever  - seen before. Imagine Paradise  - festering like a wound... then bursting! - 
 getLocaleString(582)	145 - I'm certain that the Gidbinn is very  - closely guarded. - 
 getLocaleString(583)	70 - Once the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will  - use it to strengthen the protective  - barrier around the dockside. - 
 getLocaleString(584)	75 - Since you haven't come across the  - Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper  - in the jungle nearer Kurast. - 
 getLocaleString(585)	97 - You'd best get back out there and find  - that blade. The jungle creeps further  - into this camp by the hour. - 
 getLocaleString(586)	77 - Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade  - from right under Zakarum's nose! This  - is a great day, indeed! - 
 getLocaleString(587)	41 - You have done well, noble hero. Ormus  - congratulates you. The old spirits of  - Skatsim will watch over you for  - returning their sacred blade. -   - Now, after all these years, Ormus will  - once again use his powers to protect  - the innocent from the shadow. The  - spell that protects the dockside shall  - now be reinforced. - 
 getLocaleString(588)	79 - With any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will  - grant us revenge upon the powers that  - ravaged this land. - 
 getLocaleString(589)	99 - Now that fewer of the Iron Wolves are  - needed to guard the dockside, some of  - them have volunteered to accompany  - you free of charge. - 
 getLocaleString(590)	80 - The Gidbinn's magic can only be  - channeled through Ormus. -   - Take it to him. He has the necessary  - knowledge about the ancient Skatsimi  - magics. - 
 getLocaleString(591)	62 - Who could have foreseen that the Old  - Religion would play such an effective  - role in our war against the Three?  - Again, your efforts amaze me, my  - friend. - 
 getLocaleString(592)	67 - You are truly amazing, stranger. There  - are precious few items in the world  - that would tempt me to go up against  - the Children of Zakarum and their  - midget minions. - 
 getLocaleString(593)	101 - This magic ring does me no good. -   - Here... Wear it proudly! - 
 getLocaleString(594)	36 - You have done well, my friend. Your  - courage and valor are an inspiration to  - us all. -   - But now the time has come to face  - those responsible for the evil that has  - stifled our land. You must destroy the  - High Council of Zakarum! -   - Long ago, these elders were charged  - with the stewardship of Mephisto, the  - Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned  - within the Guardian Tower. -   - Through the generations, these pious  - men slowly fell more and more under  - the sway of Mephisto's malevolent  - power and the Council became an evil  - mockery of its former glory.  -   - It is Mephisto's Hatred that has  - corrupted Zakarum and turned its  - devout followers into paranoid  - fanatics. That is why you must travel  - to the Temple City of Travincal and  - slay the Council. -   - Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold  - over this land and its people will be  - broken! - 
 getLocaleString(595)	84 - The Black Book contains some vague  - prophecies regarding this undertaking.  - I'm not so sure it will turn out well for  - you. - 
 getLocaleString(596)	90 - I am but a potion dealer and an avid  - reader of occult books. What do I know  - of the Travincal? - 
 getLocaleString(597)	54 - You must know that the Guardian Tower  - in the Temple City was built by the  - Horadrim for one purpose - to hold  - Mephisto. Once the Council is dead,  - you may enter the Tower. - 
 getLocaleString(598)	54 - You must know that the Guardian Tower  - in the Temple City was built by the  - Horadrim for one purpose -  to hold  - Mephisto. Once the Council is dead,  - you may enter the Tower. - 
 getLocaleString(599)	68 - There is only one way to the Temple  - City. You will have to cross many rivers  - and streams, but you'll find it. A great  - tower stands at its center. - 
 getLocaleString(600)	113 - It has been said that Ormus speaks  - most clearly when his ideas are utterly  - mad. - 
 getLocaleString(601)	89 - The Children of Zakarum who guard the  - Tower square can be killed, but their  - numbers are vast. You must destroy  - their Council. - 
 getLocaleString(602)	105 - There are many zealots among the  - followers of Zakarum. It will be difficult  - to get past them. - 
 getLocaleString(603)	104 - Remember. You can always find  - sanctuary here with us. - 
 getLocaleString(604)	75 - This has been a trying time for all of us,  - but I sense this nightmare is coming to  - an end. - 
 getLocaleString(605)	63 - Ormus tells me that the Council is  - comprised of tremendously powerful  - priests. It will be difficult to best them. - 
 getLocaleString(606)	93 - The Temple City is well guarded. You'd  - best keep your wits about you. - 
 getLocaleString(607)	100 - You are incredibly brave to venture into  - the lion's den. I wish you luck. - 
 getLocaleString(608)	95 - Beware the followers of Zakarum. Their  - fanaticism is their greatest weapon. - 
 getLocaleString(609)	111 - Kill as many as you can. I have a  - morbid love of excess. - 
 getLocaleString(610)	91 - If only we could have found the Black  - Book. I feel as though a malevolent  - hand has led us away from it. - 
 getLocaleString(611)	49 - If you die on this quest, I will  - commemorate your sacrifice in an epic  - poem. You will not need a potion to  - achieve immortality. Ormus' words will  - do that. - 
 getLocaleString(612)	110 - Within the Temple City is a courtyard.  - The Council resides there. - 
 getLocaleString(613)	107 - I have heard rumors that the Prime  - Evils are here seeking their Brother. - 
 getLocaleString(614)	161 - The Iron Wolves and I are at the ready  - to aid you. - 
 getLocaleString(615)	139 - Things are getting wilder than Ladies  - Night at the Slippery Fist. - 
 getLocaleString(616)	65 - The followers of Zakarum demand  - complete allegiance to their creed.  - They have slaughtered many of their  - own for minor grievances. -   - They will not hesitate to kill you. - 
 getLocaleString(617)	75 - After having served Mephisto all these  - years, the Council must be twisted by  - hatred and evil. - 
 getLocaleString(618)	81 - Sankekur may be using a Compelling  - Orb to control the minds of the  - Children of Zakarum. - 
 getLocaleString(619)	80 - I respect your need to do this. Honor  - demands that you see this through. Yet  - your chances are so slim... - 
 getLocaleString(620)	80 - I respect your need to do this. Honor  - demands that you see this through. Yet  - your chances are so slim... - 
 getLocaleString(621)	91 - You've accomplished the impossible! By  - killing the Council, the curse of  - Zakarum will be lifted and our land will  - be free! -   - Oh. Thank you! - 
 getLocaleString(622)	40 - Ormus is grateful to you, stranger. You  - have broken the long, dark reign of  - Zakarum and delivered the first  - paralyzing blow against the Three. -   - Yet still, the true test lies ahead. For he  - whom the Council guarded still lives  - within the Blackened Tower. - 
 getLocaleString(623)	76 - It seems the jungle is already dying  - back. You've broken the curse, my  - friend! May the Light bless you! - 
 getLocaleString(624)	125 - The sun has set on the Religion of Light. - 
 getLocaleString(625)	68 - The followers of Zakarum lacked all  - sense of moderation. The collapse of  - their tainted religion gives me hope. - 
 getLocaleString(626)	48 - Ridding Kurast of the Council of  - Zakarum was essential. Still, there is  - more you must do. The Compelling Orb,  - too, must be destroyed. -   - Diablo and Baal must be close to finding  - their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've  - no time to waste. - 
 getLocaleString(627)	88 - I can hardly believe you did it. Your  - power blankets you like a shining aura. - 
 getLocaleString(628)	53 - Diablo and Baal have surely found the  - Temple City by now. They seek to free  - their Brother, Mephisto, who was  - imprisoned by the Horadrim in the  - Temple's Guardian Tower. -   - You must reach him before his Brothers  - do and prevent them from releasing  - Hatred upon the world. - 
 getLocaleString(629)	90 - The hidden ways of the Tower are long  - forgotten. Though... it is rumored to  - have been built as far below the  - ground as above it. - 
 getLocaleString(630)	114 - We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure  - of his Brothers' whereabouts. - 
 getLocaleString(631)	52 - Make haste! Though the Three are sure  - to reunite, it is uncertain as to what  - they have planned once they do. -   - Be cautious, my friend. Though you are  - mighty, no mortal can stand alone  - against the power of the Prime Evils. - 
 getLocaleString(632)	52 - Make haste! Though the Three are sure  - to reunite, it is uncertain as to what  - they have planned once they do. -   - Be cautious, my friend. Though you are  - mighty, no mortal can stand alone  - against the power of the Prime Evils. - 
 getLocaleString(633)	66 - Be careful when you return to the  - Tower. Though many of the followers  - of Zakarum have fled, there's no telling  - what horrors still lurk inside it. - 
 getLocaleString(634)	116 - Move quickly, my friend, and end this  - curse once and for all! - 
 getLocaleString(635)	60 - I sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a  - scouting mission into the jungle near  - the Temple City... They encountered  - two cloaked men who attacked them  - with horrifying powers. -   - My men barely survived. I have to  - assume that the two strangers are  - Diablo and Baal. -   - You'd better hurry. They're close to  - finding their brother. - 
 getLocaleString(636)	93 - Many Iron Wolves have disappeared in  - Travincal. The Evil is still strong there. - 
 getLocaleString(637)	43 - Mephisto, along with Baal, was  - originally captured in the desert near  - Lut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the  - Brothers together was far too  - dangerous. -   - The Horadrim built the Guardian Tower  - to hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came  - to power in this land, it took over the  - Temple City without paying any heed to  - what was locked within the Tower. -   - And it became their doom. - 
 getLocaleString(638)	73 - I hear there is a little family reunion  - about to take place in Kurast. The  - Three brothers draw close. - 
 getLocaleString(639)	116 - You must reach Mephisto before his  - brothers do. - 
 getLocaleString(640)	50 - The ancient Horadrim always feared  - that the Three would escape their  - prisons and unite. I can't believe that I,  - the last of their Order, have seen it  - come to pass. -   - You are the only one who can prevent  - this, my friend. The final hour draws  - near. - 
 getLocaleString(641)	75 - Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't  - give in to your hatred. That is his  - greatest weapon against you. - 
 getLocaleString(642)	75 - Now you rush to face Mephisto. Don't  - give in to your hatred. That is his  - greatest weapon against you. - 
 getLocaleString(643)	68 - Well, the good news is that events are  - unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold.  - The bad news is that the story ends in  - our utter ruin! - 
 getLocaleString(644)	80 - I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of  - elixir preclude me from answering. - 
 getLocaleString(645)	59 - I understand that the great Patriarch of  - Zakarum, Sankekur, now embodies  - Mephisto. -   - You must overcome Hatred lest Terror  - and Destruction claim us all! - 
 getLocaleString(646)	77 - I am loath to describe what will happen  - if Diablo and Baal release Mephisto. - 
 getLocaleString(647)	110 - I ought to return to the ship. We may  - have to sail from here very quickly. - 
 getLocaleString(648)	110 - I ought to return to the ship. We may  - have to sail from here very quickly. - 
 getLocaleString(649)	80 - The sudden reduction in our ranks  - makes us eager to destroy Diablo and  - his brothers. Vengeance for the Iron  - Wolves! - 
 getLocaleString(650)	200 - We will fight to the death. - 
 getLocaleString(651)	58 - Why build a Tower to place the beast  - below ground? At times I believe the  - Horadrim lacked common sense. - 
 getLocaleString(652)	106 - Shouldn't you be running frantically up  - and down stairs about now? - 
 getLocaleString(653)	96 - Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto  - must not escape. - 
 getLocaleString(654)	96 - Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto  - must not escape. - 
 getLocaleString(655)	55 - Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the  - most powerful mortal in the world. He  - controls thousands of fanatical  - worshippers and embodies the Lord of  - Hatred, himself. His death will be no  - easy task. - 
 getLocaleString(656)	55 - Beware, my friend. Sankekur may be the  - most powerful mortal in the world. He  - controls thousands of fanatical  - worshippers and embodies the Lord of  - Hatred himself. His death will be no  - easy task. - 
 getLocaleString(657)	71 - Your news is great indeed. You have  - saved us all. I would smile, but I'm  - afraid my face might collapse. - 
 getLocaleString(658)	48 - You have defeated a Prime Evil in  - combat. Ormus is impressed beyond  - words. But staying here will not end  - this conflict. -   - You must enter the Infernal Gate and  - stop Diablo once and for all. - 
 getLocaleString(659)	70 - Ahh... Now, Kurast can begin the task  - of rekindling its former glory... I thank  - you. - 
 getLocaleString(660)	65 - Well done, my friend. You are a great  - champion of Order. Please, consider  - yourself an honorary Iron Wolf. - 
 getLocaleString(661)	121 - It looks like you're going to Hell before  - me. -   - Put in a good word. - 
 getLocaleString(662)	42 - Our faith in you was well deserved. But  - Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it  - is likely that Baal followed him there. -   - Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord  - of Terror before all is lost. Only then  - will our world be saved! - 
 getLocaleString(663)	55 - Word is spreading fast that you killed  - Mephisto. I'd be honored to fight  - beside you in Hell, but I've just received  - my mission orders. -   - I'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands  - of the North, but I can't tell you why.  - With luck, our paths will cross again.  - Farewell. - 
 getLocaleString(664)	43 - It is good to see you again, hero. -   - Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for  - the Light. I knew that you would  - eventually find your way here. The  - Pandemonium Fortress is the last  - bastion of Heaven's power before the  - Gates of the Burning Hells. -   - This place has been hallowed by the  - blood of thousands of champions of  - the Light, many of whom were mortal,  - like yourself. Now the final battle  - against the Prime Evils draws near...  - and you must face it alone.  -   - I have been forbidden to aid you  - directly, save for a few bits of wisdom.  - For this is the hour of mortal Man's  - triumph...your triumph. -   - May the Light protect you and the  - powers of Heaven shine upon your  - path... - 
 getLocaleString(665)	62 - Long ago, I swore an oath to watch  - over the Horadrim and their  - descendants. -   - As Deckard Cain is the last of their  - esteemed Order, I will not allow him to  - perish here so far from the lands of his  - birth. -   - Be at ease, hero, I know that he is your  - friend. He shall come to no harm. - 
 getLocaleString(666)	41 - Can you believe this place? Did you ever  - dare to dream that you'd one day  - stand upon the crossroads between  - Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium  - Fortress is truly miraculous. -   - However, your journey is not yet over.  - Diablo still roams free in Hell,  - marshalling his demonic forces. Only  - when he is beaten will our world finally  - have peace. -   - Hurry now... the sands of time slow for  - no one!  - 
 getLocaleString(667)	48 - I have read much about the enigmatic  - Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in  - Horadrim lore both for his compassion  - for mortals and his unquenchable  - spirit. -   - It was rumored that he went against the  - wishes of Heaven and gave the  - Horadrim the original Soulstones in  - order to trap Diablo and his Brothers. - 
 getLocaleString(668)	72 - Halt! Before venturing into Diablo's lair,  - go to the Hellforge with Mephisto's  - Soulstone. -   - Place the stone on the Hellforge and  - use the Hellforge Hammer to destroy  - it. - 
 getLocaleString(669)	66 - Proceed, hero, into Terror's lair. -   - Know that Diablo's innermost sanctum  - is hidden by five seals. -   - Only by opening each of these seals can  - you clear your way to the final battle. - 
 getLocaleString(670)	42 - There is a dark, tortured soul who was  - trapped within this forsaken realm long  - ago. He was called Izual by mortal  - men, and in ages past he was my most  - trusted Lieutenant. -   - Yet, against my wishes he led an  - ill-fated assault upon the fiery  - Hellforge, itself. -   - Despite his valor and strength, Izual  - was captured by the Prime Evils and  - twisted by their perverse power. They  - forced him to betray his own kind and  - give up Heaven's most guarded  - secrets. -   - He became a corrupt shadow of his  - former self - a fallen angel trusted  - neither by Heaven nor Hell. -   - For his transgressions, Izual's spirit  - was bound within the form of a terrible  - creature which was summoned from  - the Abyss. His maddened spirit has  - resided within that tortured husk for  - many ages now. -   - It seems to me that he has suffered  - long enough. I implore you, hero, find  - Izual and release him from his cruel  - imprisonment. -   - Put an end to his guilt and suffering. - 
 getLocaleString(671)	59 - Though Izual no longer carries the  - Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may  - still possess great strength and power  - within his new form. -   - Also, he may not be able to tell friend  - from foe while in his present state. If  - you find him, he will almost certainly be  - hostile. -   - Proceed with the utmost caution. - 
 getLocaleString(672)	54 - Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual  - the Fallen? He must have great faith in  - your abilities! -   - I trust you know what you're doing... Be  - careful. You're our last hope. - 
 getLocaleString(673)	75 - You mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual  - must be put to rest, but Diablo still  - lurks within this realm. -   - Go now... Hurry! - 
 getLocaleString(674)	83 - Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel,  - eh? -   - You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel  - like some great evil is permeating the  - air around here. - 
 getLocaleString(675)	47 - Tyrael was a fool to have trusted me! -   - You see, it was I who told Diablo and his  - Brothers about the Soulstones and how  - to corrupt them. It was I who helped  - the Prime Evils mastermind their own  - exile to your world. -   - The plan we set in motion so long ago  - cannot be stopped by any mortal  - agency.  Hell, itself, is poised to spill  - forth into your world like a tidal wave  - of blood and nightmares. -   - You and all your kind... are doomed. - 
 getLocaleString(676)	53 - Thank you, hero, for putting Izual's  - tortured spirit to rest. May the Light  - protect you and the powers of Heaven  - shine upon your path. -   - But, if what you tell me is true, then I  - fear that we have been played for fools  - all along. -   - Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers  - trick me into using the Soulstones  - against them... Now the Stones' powers  - are corrupted. -   - With the combined powers of the  - Soulstones under their control, the  - Prime Evils will be able to turn the  - mortal world into a permanent outpost  - of Hell! - 
 getLocaleString(677)	68 - You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is  - imperative that you find and stop  - Diablo! -   - You should speak of this with Tyrael. He  - will know what to make of this. - 
 getLocaleString(678)	53 - The time has come for you to destroy  - Mephisto's Soulstone! -   - Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it  - upon the forge and strike it soundly  - with the Hammer. -   - Only by doing this can you prevent  - Mephisto from manifesting in this  - world ever again. - 
 getLocaleString(679)	50 - The time has come to destroy  - Mephisto's Soulstone!  -   - Although I picked it up before entering  - the Infernal Gate, I believe you should  - carry out this crucial mission. -   - Take the Stone to the Hellforge.  Place  - it upon the forge and strike it soundly  - with the Hammer. -   - Only by doing this can you prevent  - Mephisto from manifesting in this  - world ever again. - 
 getLocaleString(680)	70 - Congratulations, hero! -   - Surely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the  - fury unleashed when you smashed his  - Brother's Soulstone. - 
 getLocaleString(681)	48 - The time has come to hunt down and  - destroy Diablo, himself. -   - But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to  - be underestimated. He single-handedly  - destroyed the town of Tristram and  - corrupted the last noble hero who tried  - to stop him. -   - This time, you must defeat him for  - good. Only by destroying the Soulstone  - which he carries will his spirit be  - banished forever. -   - Good luck! Though this be our darkest  - hour, it may yet be your greatest  - moment. - 
 getLocaleString(682)	54 - You don't have time to dally about here! -   - Diablo awaits you in Hell. Remember...  - Diablo's greatest weapon against you is  - Terror. -   - Don't give in to your fears. Resist his  - power and put an end to him for good! - 
 getLocaleString(683)	48 - The time has come to hunt down and  - destroy Diablo, himself. -   - But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to  - be underestimated. He single-handedly  - destroyed the town of Tristram and  - corrupted the last noble hero who tried  - to stop him. -   - This time, you must defeat him for  - good. Only by destroying the Soulstone  - which he carries will his spirit be  - banished forever. -   - Good luck! Though this be our darkest  - hour, it may yet be your greatest  - moment. - 
 getLocaleString(684)	62 - Praise be to the Light! You have  - accomplished the impossible! -   - Diablo and Mephisto have been  - banished back into the Black Abyss  - that spawned them and the corrupted  - Soulstones are no more. -   - You've done well, hero. For now, you  - should rejoice. - 
 getLocaleString(685)	42 - I knew there was great potential in you,  - my friend. You've done a fantastic job. -   - Though my ancestors often struggled  - against the Three Evils and their  - minions, I've always lived a shut-in,  - scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom  - aided you. -   - Now, I wish to leave this place. Though  - Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold,  - I hope I won't have to see them again  - for many, many years. -

 getLocaleString(1117)	This tower shall be cleansed of evil.

 getLocaleString(1152)	Maybe Akara could dispel the mystery of these stones.
 getLocaleString(1153)	These stones radiate powerful magic.
 getLocaleString(1154)	I sense many spirits around the stones.
 getLocaleString(1155)	It's as if a great war were fought here.
 getLocaleString(1156)	The land here is dead and lifeless.
 getLocaleString(1157)	What a tragic end to Tristram!
 getLocaleString(1158)	Tristram was no match for Diablo's fury.
 getLocaleString(1159)	All that's left of proud Tristram are ghosts and ashes.
 getLocaleString(1160)	Deckard Cain, go to the Rogues' camp without delay!
 getLocaleString(1161)	Deckard Cain, you've got to get out of here!
 getLocaleString(1162)	Deckard Cain, leave quickly!
 getLocaleString(1163)	Deckard Cain, get to the Rogue camp!
 getLocaleString(1164)	Deckard Cain, if you value your life, leave here immediately.
 getLocaleString(1165)	The Sisters will be glad to have this back!
 getLocaleString(1166)	I should take this to Charsi.
 getLocaleString(1167)	This will help the Sisters turn the tide against evil.
 getLocaleString(1168)	I hope the Sisters appreciate this thing...
 getLocaleString(1169)	All this for a hammer?
 getLocaleString(1170)	The Tower's trove... for the taking!
 getLocaleString(1171)	This is reward enough!
 getLocaleString(1172)	I've earned the right to this abandoned trove.
 getLocaleString(1173)	I hope to find other such treasures!
 getLocaleString(1174)	Treasure hunting... bah... Treasure finding... yes.
 getLocaleString(1175)	This Maiden shall inflict no more anguish.
 getLocaleString(1176)	Let the gate be opened!
 getLocaleString(1177)	My work here is finished.
 getLocaleString(1178)	The evil queen has fallen.
 getLocaleString(1179)	Back to the hell that spawned you, Andariel.
 getLocaleString(1180)	This place disgusts me.
 getLocaleString(1181)	Ugh... The tell-tale stench of a carnivore's lair.
 getLocaleString(1182)	The foul stench of evil assails me.
 getLocaleString(1183)	I sense strange magic here.
 getLocaleString(1184)	I sense a powerful undead being within this place.
 getLocaleString(1185)	Atma has been avenged.
 getLocaleString(1186)	I've just about had my fill of the walking dead.
 getLocaleString(1187)	I pray that Atma will rest easy now.
 getLocaleString(1188)	What a misguided monster.
 getLocaleString(1189)	What a waste of undead flesh.
 getLocaleString(1190)	Great. An eclipse. This just keeps getting better and better.
 getLocaleString(1191)	What is wrong with the sun?
 getLocaleString(1192)	What Evil taints the light of the sun?
 getLocaleString(1193)	Only powerful magic can conjure an eclipse.
 getLocaleString(1194)	Only the darkest magics can turn the sun black.
 getLocaleString(1195)	I hope I know what I'm doing!
 getLocaleString(1196)	The sun has never shone here!
 getLocaleString(1197)	Light guide my way in this accursed place.
 getLocaleString(1198)	I sense strong magic within this place.
 getLocaleString(1199)	This place is as dark as a tomb.
 getLocaleString(1200)	Let there be light.
 getLocaleString(1201)	It is good to know that the sun shines once again.
 getLocaleString(1202)	The Light can never be extinguished by evil.
 getLocaleString(1203)	Who would have thought that such primitive beings could cause so much trouble!
 getLocaleString(1204)	What a pity. I was beginning to enjoy the darkness.
 getLocaleString(1205)	Am I the first to find this Arcane fortress?
 getLocaleString(1206)	One could get lost in here.
 getLocaleString(1207)	This surely is the product of a twisted mind!
 getLocaleString(1208)	This place actually... distorts reality. Fascinating.
 getLocaleString(1209)	This is fantastic! I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension.
 getLocaleString(1210)	What a freak!
 getLocaleString(1211)	Stand aside, old fool. I have no time for your babblings.
 getLocaleString(1212)	Surely the evil here has driven you mad.
 getLocaleString(1213)	Is this truly Horazon?
 getLocaleString(1214)	This bumbling fool cannot be the mighty Horazon!
 getLocaleString(1215)	Good riddance, freak.
 getLocaleString(1216)	I hate staining my hands with the blood of foul sorcerers.
 getLocaleString(1217)	Rest in peace, tortured soul.
 getLocaleString(1218)	That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch.
 getLocaleString(1219)	He was not Horazon. He was a deluded fool who got too close to true power!
 getLocaleString(1220)	This has got to be the right place.
 getLocaleString(1221)	This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place.
 getLocaleString(1222)	Is this the tomb I seek?
 getLocaleString(1223)	This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb?
 getLocaleString(1224)	This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here.
 getLocaleString(1225)	Should I enter...?  Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap...
 getLocaleString(1226)	Such a cold breeze... Tal Rasha must be kept here.
 getLocaleString(1227)	Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice.
 getLocaleString(1228)	This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha!
 getLocaleString(1229)	I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside.
 getLocaleString(1230)	This is not good. Will this madness ever end?
 getLocaleString(1231)	I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy.
 getLocaleString(1232)	I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils.
 getLocaleString(1233)	Diablo and Baal have escaped me!  Next time... vengeance!
 getLocaleString(1234)	I came too late. Now... Destruction is let loose upon the world once more.
 getLocaleString(1235)	Not in Game
 getLocaleString(1236)	I hope the secrets within this book can help us.
 getLocaleString(1237)	I hope this book is worth all the trouble.
 getLocaleString(1238)	The Black Book... It's heresy to the Zakarum High Council.
 getLocaleString(1239)	This tome has the weight of knowledge about it.
 getLocaleString(1240)	This ancient book radiates arcane power!
 getLocaleString(1241)	All this trouble over a tattered book.
 getLocaleString(1242)	May this book lift the shadow from Kurast.
 getLocaleString(1243)	May the Black Book deliver us from evil!
 getLocaleString(1244)	May the Black Book bring a black day to hell!
 getLocaleString(1245)	Once the book has served its purpose, I shall delve into its secrets.
 getLocaleString(1246)	Whoa.... What died down here?
 getLocaleString(1247)	Cough... The stench down here is choking!
 getLocaleString(1248)	The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me.
 getLocaleString(1249)	It smells worse than rotting reagents down here.
 getLocaleString(1250)	It's been years since I waded through sewers for fun.
 getLocaleString(1251)	I hope this does something good...
 getLocaleString(1252)	This will drain out some of the filth.
 getLocaleString(1253)	This appears to control the ancient valves.
 getLocaleString(1254)	This looks promising.
 getLocaleString(1255)	This looks like what I've been searching for.
 getLocaleString(1256)	Eureka!
 getLocaleString(1257)	Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air!
 getLocaleString(1258)	This trove will help lift the curse from Kurast!
 getLocaleString(1259)	I hope these items can aid me against the demons.
 getLocaleString(1260)	Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer...
 getLocaleString(1261)	This dagger will separate the faithful from the fallen.
 getLocaleString(1262)	This holy blade does not belong in the hands of the Zakarum.
 getLocaleString(1263)	This blade shall pierce the heart of evil!
 getLocaleString(1264)	I must take this to Ormus.
 getLocaleString(1265)	This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it.
 getLocaleString(1266)	What would this bring from the right buyer?
 getLocaleString(1267)	What a strange little statue.
 getLocaleString(1268)	Perhaps I could trade this for something more valuable?
 getLocaleString(1269)	I don't sense any magic about this item. Very strange.
 getLocaleString(1270)	A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better.
 getLocaleString(1271)	Such a dark temple for a Religion of Light...
 getLocaleString(1272)	The spirits of nature have fled this dreaded place.
 getLocaleString(1273)	This corrupted temple was once the shining heart of my religion...
 getLocaleString(1274)	I sense tremendous evil within this place.
 getLocaleString(1275)	This temple exudes darkness.
 getLocaleString(1276)	Skatsim's reign is renewed!
 getLocaleString(1277)	The dark powers here will no longer poison the land.
 getLocaleString(1278)	The Temple shall shine anew with the Light.
 getLocaleString(1279)	The Temple's power is annulled.
 getLocaleString(1280)	The Temple's dark power is broken.
 getLocaleString(1281)	This must be where Mephisto is.
 getLocaleString(1282)	The final resting place of Hatred itself.
 getLocaleString(1283)	This must be where the Horadrim imprisoned Mephisto.
 getLocaleString(1284)	Ah... Mephisto's prison.
 getLocaleString(1285)	The Tower that holds Mephisto....
 getLocaleString(1286)	Success... But still there's something not right.
 getLocaleString(1287)	Maybe now the world will have peace.
 getLocaleString(1288)	The Lord of Hatred shall darken the world no longer.
 getLocaleString(1289)	Mephisto shall no longer darken our souls with hatred.
 getLocaleString(1290)	Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss.
 getLocaleString(1291)	Wait... Don't I get three wishes?
 getLocaleString(1292)	Even Fallen Angels deserve freedom.
 getLocaleString(1293)	How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness?
 getLocaleString(1294)	He was corrupted to the core. I pity him.
 getLocaleString(1295)	Bah! Izual was weak. He squandered his infernal power.

 getLocaleString(20000)	40 - Praise be to the Light! You have  - accomplished the impossible! -   - Diablo and Mephisto have been  - banished back into the Black Abyss  - that spawned them, and the corrupted  - Soulstones are no more. -   - However, while you were fighting here,  - Baal remained behind in the mortal  - realm, building an army of hellish  - minions. Now, Baal's army is searching  - for the Worldstone, the ancient source  - of all the Soulstones and their power,  - while leaving behind a wake of  - destruction. They have forged deeply  - into the Barbarian homelands, heading  - directly for the summit of Mount  - Arreat! -   - Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the  - very site of the blessed Worldstone! -   - Now, enter the portal I have opened for  - you. It will take you to the Barbarian  - city of Harrogath, the last bastion of  - Order on the slopes of Arreat. - 
 getLocaleString(20001)	40 - I knew there was great potential in you,  - my friend. You've done a fantastic job. -   - Though my ancestors often struggled  - against the Three Evils and their  - minions, I've always lived a shut-in,  - scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom  - aided you. -   - Now, I wish to leave this place. Though  - Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold,  - I hope I won't have to see them again  - for many, many years. -   - Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this  - place now! - 
 getLocaleString(20002)	35 - We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the  - Ancient Ones. We have been chosen to  - guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein  - the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy  - to stand in its presence; fewer still can  - comprehend its true purpose. -   - Before you enter, you must defeat us. - 
 getLocaleString(20003)	39 - I am amazed to find this place so  - untouched. Everything else in the path  - of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in  - ruin.  -   - These Barbarians must indeed be the  - legendary guardians of Mount Arreat.  - They are a proud, hardy people. Don't  - expect to be greeted warmly --  - strangers here rarely are. -   - Perhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend  - some time with the townsfolk and try  - to understand them better. I'll let you  - know what I discover. - 
 getLocaleString(20004)	52 - With hellspawn, size is no measure of  - their threat. Demons half the size of  - men can kill with a gesture, while  - hellish pack animals trample any who  - stand in their way. - 
 getLocaleString(20005)	55 - Though these Barbarians are known  - throughout the kingdoms as ferocious  - fighters, they are also capable of great  - compassion. -   - They have trained throughout history  - for a battle their legends foretell will  - decide the fate of the world. - 
 getLocaleString(20006)	55 - The angel Tyrael has watched over the  - guardians of Arreat throughout  - history. I do not believe that Baal and  - Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry  - few souls. -   - They are here to settle a conflict as old  - as time itself. - 
 getLocaleString(20007)	44 - During my time with the Horadrim, we  - often debated the nature of Mount  - Arreat. -   - We knew that the Barbarian clans  - zealously guarded the mountain as  - their sacred duty. However, many  - dismissed their zeal as simple  - superstition...combined with an inborn  - hostility toward outsiders. -   - Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat  - were never heard from again...Still, I  - do not believe they died at the hands of  - Barbarians. - 
 getLocaleString(20008)	41 - All users of the magical arts know of  - Mount Arreat, but few understand its  - true nature. It is the nexus of an  - unfathomable magic. -   - It bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction  - races to its summit with such purpose.  - I fear for the whole world should Baal  - gain what he seeks. - 
 getLocaleString(20009)	59 - I have spent decades trying to  - understand the forces at work in this  - world. But in the face of all that is  - transpiring, I realize how meager my  - knowledge is. -   - I will be of assistance where I can, my  - friend. - 
 getLocaleString(20010)	54 - Though the Elder Council of Harrogath  - is gone, there are many capable young  - leaders to take their place. -   - Anya certainly has enough courage and  - intelligence to lead them all, if they can  - survive this catastrophe. - 
 getLocaleString(20011)	53 - Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of  - feminine strength... -   - She reminds me of the Zakarum  - priestesses I knew in my youth. They  - don't take vows of chastity, you know. - 
 getLocaleString(20012)	65 - It is fortunate that this town has such a  - talented smith. -   - The quality of Larzuk's work surely  - complements your skills. In fact, he  - would have been quite welcome  - amongst the Horadrim. - 
 getLocaleString(20013)	54 - It is my belief that the Soulstones are at  - the center of this conflict. If only that  - fool Marius had not intervened, Baal  - would still be imprisoned within Tal  - Rasha. - 
 getLocaleString(20014)	54 - You have proven yourself a true hero to  - me and my people. -   - These are dark times, warrior. I hope  - you can bring an end to Baal's reign of  - destruction.  -   - Our Council of Elders is gone -- my  - father, Aust, among them. The one  - thing that keeps us from total despair  - is the promise of vengeance against  - Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(20015)	45 - Now that the Elders are all dead, I don't  - know who will guide our people through  - this dark time. I was to be next in line  - after my father, but this burden is too  - great for me to shoulder alone.  -   - We are a people of strong blood. I shall  - do what I can and let fate do the rest. - 
 getLocaleString(20016)	82 - Baal's minions are not to be trifled with.  - In their bloodlust they will sacrifice  - themselves to destroy you. - 
 getLocaleString(20017)	60 - Many outsiders believe that the  - fantastic stories about our ancestors,  - the Ancients, are but fables. However, I  - believe that the Ancients were more  - than human -- that mankind has fallen  - from what it once was. - 
 getLocaleString(20018)	58 - When I was a child, the Elders told us  - stories about the mountain and its  - power...and how the Barbarian people  - are bound to it as protectors. -   - Baal is not just taking our land -- with  - every step he takes up the mountain,  - he takes a part of who we are as a  - people. - 
 getLocaleString(20019)	72 - I am truly glad you are here, warrior.  - Perhaps things would be different now  - if we had asked for assistance from  - the neighboring kingdoms. -   - Our foolish, foolish pride... - 
 getLocaleString(20020)	54 - My father, Aust, was among those  - Elders wise enough to see that we  - would need outside help to deal with  - Baal's legions. He believed that this  - conflict would affect the entire world,  - not just our homeland. He said that  - Mount Arreat is as necessary to the  - world's survival as food and water is to  - our own. -   - I believe this to be true. - 
 getLocaleString(20021)	50 - Qual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities  - once bordered on arrogance, but in the  - early days of the siege, he was  - humbled by Baal. While he saved us  - from immediate destruction, a third of  - our warriors were lost. -   - None felt those losses more than he.  - Though he may not admit it, your  - presence gives him hope, warrior. - 
 getLocaleString(20022)	78 - If Larzuk could sing or dance half as  - well as he smiths, he'd be married by  - now. -   - ...Just look at those shoulders. - 
 getLocaleString(20023)	57 - Nihlathak was the last of our Elders,  - whose charge it was to safeguard the  - mountain. He alone tried to guide us  - through the most desperate time in our  - history -- but he was just as helpless as  - the rest of us. -   - I cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can  - learn from it. - 
 getLocaleString(20024)	60 - Our people believe that the Ancients  - protecting Mount Arreat have the  - power to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the  - Lord of Destruction has shown great  - power to undermine our faith. - 
 getLocaleString(20025)	55 - I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors  - were some of the finest craftsmen in  - Harrogath.  -   - Regretfully, my supplies run lower with  - every passing day, yet the demons  - beyond the walls have not weakened.  -   - I fear the time is near when I must put  - down my hammer and take up a sword,  - instead. - 
 getLocaleString(20026)	42 - So, you're an Amazon. I have heard  - rumors about your kind. Your unusual  - weapons could prove a challenge to my  - skills, but I'm prepared to meet it. -   - I am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors  - were some of the finest craftsmen in  - Harrogath. Regretfully, my supplies run  - lower with every passing day, yet the  - demons beyond the walls have not  - weakened. I fear the time is near when  - I must put down my hammer and take  - up a sword, instead. - 
 getLocaleString(20027)	65 - I've heard that you Amazons excel at  - killing from a distance. From what I've  - seen, that's the best way to deal with  - Hell's minions.  -   - Are all of your kind so...big? - 
 getLocaleString(20028)	65 - Why did you ever leave your beautiful  - islands to come to this frozen  - battleground? Perhaps if we both  - survive this, we'll travel back there  - together. - 
 getLocaleString(20029)	75 - Has that infernal howling been keeping  - you awake at night, too? Some think  - it's the howling of animals, but those  - sounds don't come from any beast I've  - ever known. - 
 getLocaleString(20030)	69 - Demonic forces have been using our  - own towers and barricades against us.  - You know, it would be wise to cut the  - demons down in the open before they  - can mount those fortifications. - 
 getLocaleString(20031)	70 - Nihlathak's despair is infectious -- and  - his behavior does not befit an Elder of  - his stature. I think we'd be better off  - without him. - 
 getLocaleString(20032)	63 - I've offered Qual-Kehk my ideas on how  - to break the siege, but he dismisses  - them. Is it because I lack scars of  - battle, or does he think I'm a couple  - arrows short of a quiver? - 
 getLocaleString(20033)	64 - Legend has it that the top of Mount  - Arreat is guarded by the spirits of our  - ancestors. Though our people are  - forbidden to climb to the mountain's  - summit, some foreign travelers have  - made the attempt. -   - None have ever returned. - 
 getLocaleString(20034)	66 - This is a lively town during our victory  - celebrations. We Barbarians train long  - and hard from childhood to become  - warriors, and we celebrate with equal  - fervor. -   - You didn't happen to bring along any  - ale to trade? - 
 getLocaleString(20035)	54 - Every day, one of my friends dies  - fighting outside the town walls, while I  - tend my anvil here unscathed. If only  - we didn't need weapons so badly, I  - could be out doing my share of the  - fighting.  -   - Good luck to you, warrior. - 
 getLocaleString(20036)	56 - Just so you know...The gold you pay me  - doesn't line my pockets. Much of it  - goes to buy the raw metal I need to  - melt down for weapons and armor. The  - rest -- well, all I can spare -- goes to  - Malah and Qual-Kehk for other  - supplies. - 
 getLocaleString(20037)	35 - I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath,  - the last stronghold of Order on Mount  - Arreat. You have come to the right  - place if you intend to defeat Baal the  - Lord of Destruction. -   - Baal has laid waste to our mountain  - and its denizens. His minions continue  - to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk  - and his men have proven helpless to  - stop them. Baal is still out on the  - mountain looking for something -- but I  - know not what.  -   - All of the Elders, save Nihlathak,  - sacrificed themselves to place a  - protective ward around Harrogath. -   - Some of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do  - not appreciate your presence. We are a  - proud people, and it is not easy for us  - to accept aid. I, however, am glad you  - are here. -   - If you need healing or a potion, please  - come to me. See Larzuk for weapons,  - armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite  - his disposition, may be of some  - assistance with other wares. Finally,  - Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads  - Harrogath's remaining forces against  - Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(20038)	36 - A Sorceress...Here in Harrogath? -   - There was a time, child, when I thought  - I was destined to follow your kind's  - path. However, my powers never  - developed beyond the simplest of  - spells. Although I can heal almost any  - wound with time and energy, there is  - little I can do to help against Baal. -   - But enough of that...I spend too much  - time in reflection and have forgotten  - my manners. -   - I, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath,  - the last stronghold of Order on Mount  - Arreat. You have come to the right  - place, if you intend to defeat Baal the  - Lord of Destruction. -   - Baal has laid waste to our mountain  - and its denizens. His minions continue  - to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk  - and his men have proven helpless to  - stop them. Baal is still out on the  - mountain looking for something -- but I  - know not what.  -   - All of the Elders, save Nihlathak,  - sacrificed themselves to place a  - protective ward around Harrogath. -   - Some of us here, certainly Nihlathak, do  - not appreciate your presence. We are a  - proud people, and it is not easy for us  - to accept aid. I, however, am glad you  - are here. -   - If you need healing or a potion, please  - come to me. See Larzuk for weapons,  - armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite  - his disposition, may be of some  - assistance with other wares. Finally,  - Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads  - Harrogath's remaining forces against  - Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(20039)	34 - You have traveled far only to return  - home to us, Barbarian. Ohh...Much has  - happened in Harrogath since you left.  - Our homeland is hardly recognizable  - with so much evil about. -   - Yet, I've managed to survive so far.  - You've seen your share of suffering as  - well, I'm sure. Seeing you again -- alive  - -- does my heart good. I shall pray that  - you can help us out of this hell. -   - Baal has laid waste to our mountain  - and its denizens. His minions continue  - to attack our town, while Qual-Kehk  - and his men have proven helpless to  - stop them. Baal is still out on the  - mountain looking for something -- but I  - know not what. -   - Nihlathak is the last survivor of the  - Council of Elders, but I'm afraid he has  - not been himself lately. The other  - Elders sacrificed themselves to place a  - protective ward around Harrogath. If  - Nihlathak is curt with you, it is because  - he feels responsible for our situation.  - He does not relish sending more of our  - people out to die. -   - So much has changed since you left  - that I see little hope for us in this life. -   - If you need healing or a potion, please  - come to me. See Larzuk for weapons,  - armor, and repairs. Nihlathak, despite  - his disposition, may be of some  - assistance with other wares. Finally,  - Qual-Kehk, our Man-At-Arms, leads  - Harrogath's remaining forces against  - Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(20040)	53 - I'm aware of the amazing magical  - powers a Sorceress can channel. If we  - survive Baal's wrath, I would be most  - honored if you could demonstrate and  - perhaps teach me something of what  - you know.  -   - I may be old, but I'm not dead. - 
 getLocaleString(20041)	42 - I know you and my son, Bannuk, did not  - part on the best of terms. He did not  - understand the wanderlust that drove  - you to leave your homeland. However,  - even though Bannuk could never admit  - it to me, as he grew older I could see  - that same desire in his eyes. -   - Oh...It's a pity I didn't encourage him to  - go with you. He might still be alive  - today. - 
 getLocaleString(20042)	57 - Though once considered shelter by our  - people, the Ice Caves offer no refuge  - from the dark horde. There are  - creatures there that will freeze your  - heart before feasting upon it. - 
 getLocaleString(20043)	107 - On the battlefield, turning your back on  - even the dead is unwise. - 
 getLocaleString(20044)	60 - This battle plays mind tricks on our  - warriors. Those fortunate enough to  - have returned from the mountainside  - claim to have seen angels in flight. -   - Fly they might, but that certainly does  - not make them angels. - 
 getLocaleString(20045)	53 - Perhaps you have heard the accounts  - of my son's horrible death at the hands  - of Baal's minions. He was my last living  - child... -   - The oath of compassion I have taken as  - a healer extends only to humankind. -   - Cut them down, warrior. All of them! - 
 getLocaleString(20046)	78 - The catapults are infernal machines  - made of demon flesh fused with steel. -   - Be wary of them. - 
 getLocaleString(20047)	60 - Qual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the  - losses have borne heavily upon him. He  - is only impatient because he judges the  - worth of a warrior by action, not  - words. -   - You must prove yourself worthy of his  - trust. - 
 getLocaleString(20048)	52 - Larzuk possesses a good soul, but at  - times his mind seems quite unsound.  -   - He once asked me for twenty of my  - finest sheepskins. He said he would fill  - them with hot air and float like a cloud  - above the battlefield to spy on Baal's  - legions!  -   - I worry the siege has driven him mad. - 
 getLocaleString(20049)	90 - Be cautious, warrior. -   - Though I am an experienced healer,  - resurrection is beyond my powers. - 
 getLocaleString(20050)	53 - I pray for the day when the fields are  - covered in snow unstained by the blood  - of our own. Perhaps that day will come  - soon...Perhaps never... -   - Oh...But I forget myself. How may I aid  - your quest? - 
 getLocaleString(20051)	64 - Your gold is most helpful. Medical  - supplies for our wounded are scarce  - and very expensive. -   - When we can find a supplier, oh, we  - must pay dearly for what we need. - 
 getLocaleString(20052)	44 - With the exception of Qual-Kehk, the  - townspeople do not see what I see --  - the massacre we face. -   - Our bravest, strongest heroes hobble  - back to me begging for help. I do what  - I can -- healing and bandaging some,  - preparing the others for what lies  - beyond. - 
 getLocaleString(20053)	43 - Well, well. The siege has everything in  - short supply...except fools.  -   - Why would you seek this place,  - stranger? Are you a vulture come to  - loot the bodies of our fallen warriors?  -   - Regardless, this is no place to make a  - name for yourself. The mountain is  - ours to protect. It is only a matter of  - time before Hell's legions are routed. - 
 getLocaleString(20054)	54 - Well, well...An Assassin! -   - Heh, heh...While I am sure we are all  - grateful for your presence in our  - troubled town, you need not have made  - the journey. -   - I can personally say that your skills are  - not required here. You would serve  - your clan better elsewhere. - 
 getLocaleString(20055)	45 - Ahhh, a Necromancer. -   - While I admire your courage in seeking  - out the darker side of magic, we really  - have little need of your skills. The  - battle will turn soon enough without  - your meddling.  -   - Yet, I should have expected to see your  - kind here. You are like a moth to the  - flame -- drawn to all this death. It  - feeds you in more ways than one, does  - it not? - 
 getLocaleString(20056)	49 - If you're looking for cases of  - treacherous magic, Assassin, take a  - hard look at Larzuk. He was the only  - one in town who escaped the Red Fever  - last spring. He claimed his good  - fortune was due to 'hand washing'  - before meals. -   - Hmmm...Very suspicious... - 
 getLocaleString(20057)	48 - Why would you seek this place,  - stranger? Are you a vulture come to  - loot the bodies of our fallen warriors?  -   - Regardless, this is no place to make a  - name for yourself. The mountain is  - ours to protect. It is only a matter of  - time before Hell's legions are routed. - 
 getLocaleString(20058)	67 - Qual-Kehk is useless. He has blindly  - sent our warriors to their deaths,  - assuming Baal's legions would fight as  - men do. Of course, everyone knows  - they do not. - 
 getLocaleString(20059)	57 - The demon hordes have grown powerful  - beyond measure, aided by our foolish  - mistakes. But I may have found a way  - to correct those mistakes... - 
 getLocaleString(20060)	37 - Oh yes...I remember our warriors as  - children. Malah would set their broken  - bones and give them powders for their  - fevers. Now, they return to her with  - wounds that will never heal. -   - I am tired...Please...leave me. - 
 getLocaleString(20061)	133 - If you have nothing useful for me, be on  - your way! - 
 getLocaleString(20062)	81 - Anya's father was my good friend.  - There are so many to mourn...I have  - no time for you! - 
 getLocaleString(20063)	53 - I have long been criticized, but  - especially of late -- since the deaths of  - my fellow Elders. Through it all, I have  - learned one thing. Each man must do  - what's right, no matter what others  - may think. - 
 getLocaleString(20064)	65 - The Council of Elders always believed  - itself prepared for the coming of the  - Three. Obviously, we were not prepared  - enough. - 
 getLocaleString(20065)	45 - I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms  - of Harrogath. -   - You have the look of a warrior...An  - extra soldier will be useful. But don't  - expect anyone to mourn if you get  - yourself killed.  -   - Baal is true to his namesake. He has  - ravaged through our lands like a  - merciless plague. -   - The protective ward laid down by our  - lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay,  - but Baal's siege has taken its toll all  - the same. -   - Most of my men are now dead. Others  - are trapped in the mountain passes. -   - But I swear we are not beaten yet! We  - will fight to the end to protect this  - mountain! - 
 getLocaleString(20066)	42 - A Paladin! I have long heard of your  - people. -   - As a young warrior I even considered  - the pilgrimage to Kurast. But I was  - younger then and foolish. My place has  - always been here -- protecting  - Harrogath, and Mount Arreat with it. -   - I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms  - of Harrogath. -   - You have the look of a warrior...An  - extra soldier will be useful. But don't  - expect anyone to mourn if you get  - yourself killed.  -   - Baal is true to his namesake. He has  - ravaged through our lands like a  - merciless plague. -   - The protective ward laid down by our  - lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay,  - but Baal's siege has taken its toll all  - the same. -   - Most of my men are now dead. Others  - are trapped in the mountain passes. -   - But I swear we are not beaten yet! We  - will fight to the end to protect this  - mountain! - 
 getLocaleString(20067)	42 - A Druid in Harrogath! Have things truly  - come to this? -   - After the Mage Wars, I assumed Druids  - would never be seen in Harrogath  - again. You take a big chance coming  - here!  -   - To be honest, I have never been  - comfortable with your shape-shifting  - kind, but I do respect your search for  - balance and peace. So, if you trust us  - enough to enter our gates, I trust you  - enough to let you stay. -   - I am Qual-Kehk, the Senior Man-At-Arms  - of Harrogath. -   - You have the look of a warrior...An  - extra soldier will be useful. But don't  - expect anyone to mourn if you get  - yourself killed.  -   - Baal is true to his namesake. He has  - ravaged through our lands like a  - merciless plague. -   - The protective ward laid down by our  - lost Elders helps hold the evil at bay,  - but Baal's siege has taken its toll all  - the same. -   - Most of my men are now dead. Others  - are trapped in the mountain passes. -   - But I swear we are not beaten yet! We  - will fight to the end to protect this  - mountain! - 
 getLocaleString(20068)	67 - It would be an honor to have a warrior  - of the Light fighting side-by-side with  - my men. -   - I can see your faith gives you great  - strength, Paladin, but don't expect it to  - keep you out of harm's way. - 
 getLocaleString(20069)	61 - Harrogath has great need of your  - powers, noble Druid. However, in the  - face of this supernatural onslaught,  - are your natural powers up to the  - task? - 
 getLocaleString(20070)	44 - The death of Malah's son was a great  - tragedy. He was our finest archer. -   - While leading a successful campaign  - against Baal's forces, he was impaled  - on a demon's spear. The wound was  - such that...Well, even Malah herself  - acknowledges that quick death was a  - blessing. - 
 getLocaleString(20071)	57 - We have lost many well-trained warriors  - to Baal's siege machines. Their range is  - great. Though, they are vulnerable if  - you close the distance quickly enough. - 
 getLocaleString(20072)	96 - Baal's legions seem countless, but  - slaying their commanders takes some  - of the fight out of them. - 
 getLocaleString(20073)	58 - Early on, parties of our best scouts  - were ambushed by demons that  - spawned from the very air around  - them. Survivors often mentioned a  - strange creature floating in the  - distance. -   - Perhaps taking it down could prevent  - some nasty surprises. - 
 getLocaleString(20074)	57 - This is unlike any battle I have ever  - fought. While we ration food and  - water, the demon hordes feast nightly  - on the flesh and blood of our dead. - 
 getLocaleString(20075)	48 - Larzuk is a talented blacksmith, but his  - head is full of some strange ideas.  -   - Just the other day he came to me with a  - plan to break the siege. He wanted to  - fill large pipes with exploding powders  - and steel balls, then...Well, like I said,  - strange. - 
 getLocaleString(20076)	46 - Our Elders were wise leaders in more  - peaceful times, but now the survival of  - our people has fallen to me. My men  - and I will fight to the death, but there's  - no way to ensure the outcome. -   - I used to believe that nothing could  - break through our guard and assault  - the holy mountain. I know now that I  - was horribly mistaken. - 
 getLocaleString(20077)	45 - If you're here to defeat Baal, you must  - prove it! -   - As we speak, Harrogath is under siege  - by Baal's demons. Catapults rain death  - just outside the town walls. -   - Baal himself travels up the sacred  - mountain, having left in charge here  - one of his most vicious generals, Shenk  - the Overseer. A ruthless taskmaster,  - he lashes his own minions into suicidal  - frenzies on the battlefield. -   - If you wish to prove yourself to us,  - destroy the monster, Shenk, that  - commands those infernal catapults  - outside Harrogath.  If you manage to  - do this, return to me. - 
 getLocaleString(20078)	150 - Uh...Did I mention there were catapults? - 
 getLocaleString(20079)	83 - I believe that stopping the siege on  - Harrogath is the only way for you to  - earn the trust of these people. - 
 getLocaleString(20080)	84 - You've proven your skill at rescuing fair  - maidens...but how are you at killing  - vicious beasts? - 
 getLocaleString(20081)	77 - Qual-Kehk and his men have been  - fighting to break the siege for some  - time. Where many have failed, you may  - succeed. - 
 getLocaleString(20082)	70 - After so many have died, who are you  - to think you can accomplish what our  - proud warriors could not? - 
 getLocaleString(20083)	66 - About to face Shenk the Overseer and  - stop the siege, are you? You should  - ask Malah to perform your last rites  - before you go, stranger. - 
 getLocaleString(20084)	90 - What's the matter, hero? Questioning  - your fortitude? I know we are. - 
 getLocaleString(20085)	105 - I understand your reluctance, but now  - is the time to strike. - 
 getLocaleString(20086)	66 - Those demons have been out there  - since before your arrival. Can you do  - nothing to stop them? -   - Your task is a simple one, warrior. Find  - Shenk and destroy him. - 
 getLocaleString(20087)	64 - This may not be very encouraging, but  - you have fared better than the others  - who passed through those gates. -   - In regards to Shenk the Overseer,  - remember: a general is nothing without  - his men. - 
 getLocaleString(20088)	78 - What are you still doing here? I thought  - you were going off to die. -   - Go...Be quick about it. - 
 getLocaleString(20089)	93 - So, you still live. You're either quick or a  - coward. - 
 getLocaleString(20090)	63 - You're an even greater warrior than I  - expected...Sorry for underestimating  - you. -   - As a token of my appreciation, I will  - craft sockets into an item of your  - choosing, and from now on, you'll get  - the best price for all my wares. - 
 getLocaleString(20091)	60 - Those catapults were like nothing I have  - ever seen before. You have prevailed  - against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is  - still far ahead of you. - 
 getLocaleString(20092)	108 - I was starting to wonder how long it  - would take you to stop those beasts. -   - Good job. - 
 getLocaleString(20093)	94 - Oh...At last, the siege is ended. You  - truly are an angel. -   - I thank you. - 
 getLocaleString(20094)	65 - Ending the siege does not earn  - immediate respect, outsider. -   - Respect only comes with sacrifice --  - something I'm sure you know nothing  - of. - 
 getLocaleString(20095)	68 - So...You managed to stop the siege. -   - You are more powerful than I gave you  - credit for. You have rightfully earned  - my respect. - 
 getLocaleString(20096)	58 - My concerns have turned to my men  - taken prisoner on the battlefield by  - Baal's demons. I hate to think what's  - happened to them. -   - As you journey up the mountain, keep  - your eyes open for my soldiers and  - bring them back to me if you can. - 
 getLocaleString(20097)	85 - Those of my men fortunate enough to  - escape on their own told me that they  - were held captive in the highlands and  - plateaus. - 
 getLocaleString(20098)	74 - I know firsthand that captivity is a sad  - fate for a man. Find them quickly. - 
 getLocaleString(20099)	85 - If those men are being treated like I  - was, you must find them. They won't  - survive much longer. - 
 getLocaleString(20100)	73 - I crafted the swords and armor for  - Qual-Kehk's men. They were like  - brothers to me. I can't imagine the pain  - they must be suffering. -   - Save them if you can! - 
 getLocaleString(20101)	84 - Qual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned  - for some time. They are certain to be  - tired and weak. -   - You must protect them once you free  - them. - 
 getLocaleString(20102)	94 - You have proven you can take life,  - warrior, but can you save it as well? - 
 getLocaleString(20103)	95 - They say that discretion, not  - procrastination, is the better part of  - valor. - 
 getLocaleString(20104)	78 - More of my men are still alive out there.  - I am certain of it! -   - Find them. Free them from their cages  - and bring them back to me. - 
 getLocaleString(20105)	63 - If you are having trouble finding  - Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to  - Malah. She healed those who made it  - back before. Perhaps she would have  - some advice. - 
 getLocaleString(20106)	115 - Well, you found me on the mountain; I'm  - sure you'll find them too. - 
 getLocaleString(20107)	76 - As a kid, I used to play soldier among  - the barricades on the mountain.  - There's no easy way through that maze  - of walls. - 
 getLocaleString(20108)	67 - Soldiers who made it back told of a  - system of barricades placed among the  - mountain passes. They said that is  - where the prisoners are held. - 
 getLocaleString(20109)	52 - Did you ever stop to think why these  - demons are capturing Qual-Kehk's  - men? Why they are attacking us? Have  - you considered what Baal wants with  - the mountain? -   - No. You've not. You have no idea what  - you are dealing with. - 
 getLocaleString(20110)	51 - Thank you for rescuing my men. They  - have spoken well of your bravery in  - battle. Perhaps there is hope for us  - after all.  -   - If you wish, you may hire some of my  - mercenaries that you saved. And  - please...take this set of runes. I had  - been saving them for a socketed shield,  - but I think you'll make better use of  - them. -   - Be sure to set them in the right order  - for their fullest effect. - 
 getLocaleString(20111)	80 - You've become a hero to this town, my  - friend. The shadows have lifted ever  - since you brought the Light to  - Harrogath. - 
 getLocaleString(20112)	107 - I'm sure those men appreciate the  - freedom you gave them...as much as I  - do. - 
 getLocaleString(20113)	55 - Since your arrival, Cain has spoken of  - your deeds in the Southern Kingdoms,  - defeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At  - first, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm  - finding them more believable with every  - passing day. - 
 getLocaleString(20114)	73 - You have inspired the people in this  - town -- not only those you rescued, but  - those you've helped in other ways as  - well. - 
 getLocaleString(20115)	72 - So. You brought the lost sheep home to  - the shepherd. Well done. - 
 getLocaleString(20116)	43 - There is a matter which I hesitate to  - share, but I believe you are the only  - one who can help me now. -   - Anya, the young alchemist and  - daughter to one of our slain Elders,  - has been missing for some time. She is  - a strong, crafty woman with a spirit  - like no other. -   - One night, just before your arrival, I  - overheard her and Nihlathak arguing  - about her father's death. The next  - morning she was gone. -   - Nihlathak has his own tale as to where  - she went and why. Don't believe him! I  - fear he is at the root of her  - disappearance. -   - Please, if you can, search for Anya and  - bring her back to us. She'll know what  - to do about Nihlathak. - 
 getLocaleString(20117)	94 - When you talk to Nihlathak, be careful.  - There is no telling what he will say or  - do. - 
 getLocaleString(20118)	59 - I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak  - speaks with a venomous tongue and  - acts as if the entire weight of this town  - rests upon his shoulders. -   - Perhaps there is more going on here  - than we know. - 
 getLocaleString(20119)	57 - Anya is an amazing alchemist,  - especially for her young age. As long  - as I've known her, she's never let  - anything stop her from pursuing what  - she believed in.  -   - I wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is  - involved. Ever since her father died,  - they haven't gotten along. - 
 getLocaleString(20120)	41 - Anya! Who have you been talking to?  - Likely it was that meddling Malah.  -   - Well, I'll tell you what really happened.  - Anya came to me for guidance, after  - receiving a vision that her mother and  - younger brother were trapped in the  - lands beyond the Ice Caves. She had  - decided to go rescue them.  -   - I told her that her quest was a foolish  - one and that she would be safer  - staying within the city walls. However,  - she is a willful girl and would not listen  - to me.  -   - The next morning, she was gone. No  - one is more distraught than I over  - losing her.  -   - However, if you feel the need to be  - Malah's errand child, I won't try to stop  - you. - 
 getLocaleString(20121)	43 - Anya's father, Aust, was our wisest  - Elder. He was killed along with the  - other Elders who erected the ward that  - protects this city. The ward has kept  - Baal's demons out of Harrogath, but at  - a costly sacrifice.  -   - Nihlathak, on the other hand, was the  - only Elder to escape the demons.  - Somehow, he alone managed to find  - sanctuary, while the others died  - around him. -   - Ever since that day, Nihlathak and Anya  - have been at odds. - 
 getLocaleString(20122)	52 - If it were anyone else, I would assume  - her dead. However, Anya is not so  - easily beaten. I know she must be alive. - 
 getLocaleString(20123)	60 - Nihlathak's story does sound  - reasonable, considering what I've  - heard about Anya. However, the best  - lies are often hidden within truth. - 
 getLocaleString(20124)	56 - As the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is  - the only person, besides Nihlathak,  - who has any real knowledge of Mount  - Arreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our  - fate in the hands of Nihlathak alone. - 
 getLocaleString(20125)	46 - Look, I've told you! She's dead! If you  - knew what was good for you, you'd  - concentrate your efforts on saving  - Harrogath -- not on lost causes like  - Anya. - 
 getLocaleString(20126)	81 - It seems like everyone feels Nihlathak  - played a part in Anya's disappearance. -   - Why would he do such a thing? - 
 getLocaleString(20127)	56 - So! That snake Nihlathak was behind  - Anya's disappearance...and he trapped  - her with a freezing curse. -   - Here. Take this potion to Anya and give  - it to her. That should release her. - 
 getLocaleString(20128)	54 - Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen  - Barbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah  - can help you where I cannot. - 
 getLocaleString(20129)	80 - Poor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak  - was a traitor... -   - If you find him alive, kill him for me! - 
 getLocaleString(20130)	70 - The snake has slipped our grasp! While  - you were gone, Nihlathak disappeared. -   - I'll bet Anya knows how to track him  - down. - 
 getLocaleString(20131)	50 - Hero. Nihlathak did this to me! -   - If you've come to help me, my only hope  - lies with Malah. -   - Please...Tell her you've found me... - 
 getLocaleString(20132)	48 - Thank you so much for bringing Anya  - back to us. I have devised this spell to  - increase your resistances as a token of  - my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I  - hope you find it helpful. -   - Please go talk to Anya. She has urgent  - news concerning Nihlathak. - 
 getLocaleString(20133)	62 - For one so young, Anya commands  - great respect. Now that she is here, I  - will make it a point to talk to her about  - Mount Arreat. -   - You should do the same. - 
 getLocaleString(20134)	67 - I never liked Nihlathak, but I never  - suspected that he'd betray us! I just  - can't understand how an Elder could do  - such a thing. - 
 getLocaleString(20135)	140 - Your rescue of Anya was quite an  - accomplishment. - 
 getLocaleString(20136)	80 - Thank you, hero, for rescuing me. -   - To show my personal gratitude, I give  - you this. I had it custom-made for you  - by Larzuk. - 
 getLocaleString(20137)	43 - Nihlathak told me he struck a deal with  - Baal to protect Harrogath. In exchange  - for the demon's mercy, the misguided  - fool plans to give Baal the Relic of the  - Ancients, our most holy totem! -   - Doing so will allow Baal to enter Mount  - Arreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I  - tried to stop Nihlathak, but he  - imprisoned me in that icy tomb. -   - Nihlathak must be stopped before he  - dooms the whole world. As much as I  - would love to strangle the life out of  - him, I'm afraid I haven't the strength. -   - You must go to his lair through this  - portal I've opened, kill him, and then  - bring back the Relic of the Ancients. -   - Stop Nihlathak from destroying what we  - have striven for eons to protect. - 
 getLocaleString(20138)	90 - As noble as Nihlathak's intentions are,  - nothing can excuse his actions. - 
 getLocaleString(20139)	50 - Regretfully, I know very little about this  - Relic. However, if what the others say  - is true, then Baal must not gain  - possession of it. -   - Stop Nihlathak...before all is lost. - 
 getLocaleString(20140)	65 - My worst fear has come true. Nihlathak  - has gone mad. -   - You must stop him, before he gives the  - Relic to the Lord of Destruction! - 
 getLocaleString(20141)	56 - Now, rescuing Anya -- that's good.  - Talking to me while Nihlathak hands  - over the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad! - 
 getLocaleString(20142)	60 - I saw Nihlathak leave town just before  - you found Anya. He must be held  - accountable for his criminal deeds. -   - Find him and bring him back, if you can.  - Likely, he won't come willingly, and  - you'll be forced to kill him. -   - So be it. - 
 getLocaleString(20143)	55 - Nihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the  - Relic, he shall enter the mountain and  - wreak havoc there! -   - I cannot believe that Nihlathak would  - give the Relic to Baal in any kind of  - trade. He's truly insane if he believes  - that he can deal with the Lord of  - Destruction. - 
 getLocaleString(20144)	58 - Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of  - events. -   - I know it seems you have always been  - one step behind, my friend. But look at  - it this way...You have evil on the run. - 
 getLocaleString(20145)	160 - ...What's there to talk about? -   - Kill Nihlathak! - 
 getLocaleString(20146)	63 - Nihlathak was never the kindest man.  - But for him to betray the whole world... -   - Ahh...Where shall his soul finally rest? - 
 getLocaleString(20147)	65 - My advice is to go in quick and hit hard.  - Nihlathak can't be half as tough as the  - beasts you've faced out there. - 
 getLocaleString(20148)	55 - You have stopped Nihlathak, but he  - didn't have the Relic! He must have  - already given it to Baal. Now, Baal will  - not be tested when he reaches Arreat's  - summit. -   - ...Damn Nihlathak! -   - I do thank you for trying, though.  - Please, allow me to honor your courage  - by magically inscribing your name onto  - an item of your choosing. It's the least  - I can do. - 
 getLocaleString(20149)	90 - Beware! Baal grows stronger with every  - passing moment. - 
 getLocaleString(20150)	93 - Hmmm...What does Baal plan to do  - inside Mount Arreat? - 
 getLocaleString(20151)	65 - So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on  - failures past. It is your future that  - matters more. - 
 getLocaleString(20152)	57 - Nihlathak was a vile demon that shall  - find his home among the tortured  - minions of Hell! -   - You battled the Darkness without fear. I  - laud your skill and courage. - 
 getLocaleString(20153)	37 - Every time I hear of you, warrior, your  - deeds become more legendary. -   - But take heed. You are approaching the  - very summit of Mount Arreat. I have  - never dared venture there. It is sacred  - -- our most holy place. The legends say  - it is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who  - block the path of all who are unworthy. -   - Your reputation here does not  - matter...It will be the Ancients who  - determine your worthiness. -   - Good luck. - 
 getLocaleString(20154)	63 - The Ancients are not our enemies.  - Remember that! They are our  - ancestors -- our gods. - 
 getLocaleString(20155)	90 - A test of mettle is a fitting rite of  - passage for a Barbarian hero. - 
 getLocaleString(20156)	72 - You wouldn't have to test yourself  - against the Ancients if it weren't for  - Nihlathak's treachery. He was a fool  - and deserves to suffer for eternity. - 
 getLocaleString(20157)	75 - Every night, I've prayed to the Ancients  - to bring us peace...and now you must  - fight them. -   - Huh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior? - 
 getLocaleString(20158)	65 - By reaching the summit, you cease  - being just a simple warrior. When you  - come back, you will be far more. - 
 getLocaleString(20159)	114 - I warned you! -   - The Ancients are not like the demons  - you're accustomed to fighting. - 
 getLocaleString(20160)	52 - We have come too far to be defeated  - now, my friend. I have seen you  - complete many difficult quests. Though  - this may be your greatest trial, it is not  - beyond your reach. - 
 getLocaleString(20161)	71 - Look. I must apologize. -   - I feel responsible for your current  - struggle. If I had only stopped  - Nihlathak from giving Baal the Relic,  - you would not have to fight those  - ghosts. - 
 getLocaleString(20162)	70 - You've walked on the burial grounds of  - our greatest ancestors. I'm not sure  - whether I should bow before you or  - revile you for committing sacrilege. -   - Tread lightly when you walk with gods. - 
 getLocaleString(20163)	68 - Do not doubt yourself. I believe you are  - worthy to pass through the Ancients'  - gates, but you must believe, as well. - 
 getLocaleString(20164)	75 - Besting the Ancients in battle is a  - mighty feat indeed. I hope this means  - you're ready to battle Baal. - 
 getLocaleString(20165)	67 - You have proven yourself to these  - people. They look to you as their  - warrior, their champion. - 
 getLocaleString(20166)	82 - You stand before me a worthy hero --  - and on you rests the last hope of our  - people. -   - Bear it well, warrior. - 
 getLocaleString(20167)	82 - The Ancients have honored you, and in  - turn, so do we. I have no remaining  - doubts about you, now. - 
 getLocaleString(20168)	60 - I knew the Ancients would find you  - worthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now,  - stop Baal before he destroys all that is  - sacred. - 
 getLocaleString(20169)	31 - You are a worthy hero! We augment  - your skill and grant you entry to the  - interior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies  - the Worldstone. -   - Beware. You will not be alone. Baal the  - Lord of Destruction is already inside.  -   - The Archangel Tyrael has always been  - our benefactor, but even he cannot  - help us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's  - spiritual presence from entering the  - chamber of the Worldstone. Only you,  - mortal, have the power to defeat Baal  - now. -   - Baal threatens the Worldstone -- and  - through it, the mortal realm, itself. You  - must stop him before he gains full  - control of the sacred stone. With it  - under his control, Baal could shatter  - the boundaries between this world and  - the Burning Hells, thus allowing the  - hordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth  - into the mortal realm like an  - unstoppable tide! -   - If you are weak, the world as you know  - it could be lost forever. You must NOT  - fail! - 
 getLocaleString(20170)	51 - Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal  - Rasha, one of the most powerful of the  - ancient Horadrim. -   - Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo  - will pale in comparison to your battle  - with Baal. -   - The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal  - Rasha's knowledge...The mountain  - itself will tremble when you clash. - 
 getLocaleString(20171)	59 - I may be just an armorer, but I know  - this...Baal plans to destroy the world  - with the secrets contained in that  - mountain. It doesn't take a genius to  - know he has to be stopped. - 
 getLocaleString(20172)	70 - You knew it would eventually come down  - to this. Kill Baal! Finish the game! - 
 getLocaleString(20173)	60 - Baal has blocked Tyrael from entering  - the Worldstone Chamber? This truly  - has become a battle against Hell. -   - Whether or not it was the Heavens'  - decree, this is your fight now -- your  - destiny. - 
 getLocaleString(20174)	63 - You have ventured to a place beyond  - legend. You rush to face an evil few  - can even imagine. -   - Be careful, my friend, and may the Light  - watch over you. - 
 getLocaleString(20175)	40 - I am impressed, mortal. You have  - overcome the greatest challenge this  - world has ever faced and defeated the  - last of the Prime Evils. However, we are  - too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's  - destructive touch has corrupted it  - completely. -   - Given enough time, the Worldstone's  - energies will drain away and the  - barriers between the worlds will  - shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood  - into this...Sanctuary...and eradicate  - your people and everything you've  - labored to build. -   - Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted  - Worldstone before the powers of Hell  - take root. This act will change your  - world forever -- with consequences  - even I cannot foresee. However, it is  - the only way to ensure mankind's  - survival. -   - Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal  - that will lead you to safety. -   - May the Eternal Light shine upon you  - and your descendants for what you've  - done this day. The continued survival  - of mankind is your legacy! Above all  - else, you have earned a rest from this  - endless battle. - 
 getLocaleString(20176)	53 - You have done the impossible, hero.  - Your defeat of the last of the three  - Prime Evils is a great victory for the  - Light.  -   - Strange that you say that the  - Worldstone must be destroyed. The  - prophecies said nothing about that. -   - Perhaps all we have fought for will be  - lost...or perhaps we'll never need fight  - again! - 
 getLocaleString(20177)	40 - I knew in time you would defeat Baal.  - You have done everything you set out  - to do, my friend. -   - Ever since you rescued me from  - Tristram, I have believed in you. It has  - been a supreme honor to aid you along  - the way.  -   - So...The Worldstone was corrupted by  - Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it.  - Worry not. Through whatever lies  - ahead I have faith that the Light will  - guide us both. -   - Go, now, back to the Worldstone  - chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael  - has opened for you. - 
 getLocaleString(20178)	74 - The Ancients themselves will envy our  - songs about you. -   - Please, don't forget about us! Farewell,  - my friend. - 
 getLocaleString(20179)	48 - If Tyrael says the Worldstone must be  - destroyed, then it must. We cannot let  - Baal's corruption prevail! -   - The world will change, true -- but who is  - to say it isn't for the better? - 
 getLocaleString(20180)	60 - The destruction of the Worldstone does  - not bode well for our world. But I'll try  - not to worry... -   - After all, we have warriors like you  - fighting for us and for the Light. -   - Farewell! -

 getLocaleString(21896)	They'll never see me coming.
 getLocaleString(21897)	So dark... perfect.
 getLocaleString(21898)	So, this is where evil hides.
 getLocaleString(21899)	Whose handiwork lies buried here?
 getLocaleString(21900)	Planting the dead... How odd.
 getLocaleString(21901)	Such corruption in this place...
 getLocaleString(21902)	Evil flows from here.
 getLocaleString(21903)	Who would want to remember this place?
 getLocaleString(21904)	I can smell why this tower was abandoned.
 getLocaleString(21905)	Try and cage me, demons.
 getLocaleString(21906)	Bars can't hold a force of nature.
 getLocaleString(21907)	I don't like it down here.
 getLocaleString(21908)	The supernatural is strong here.
 getLocaleString(21909)	The Rogues' test is done.
 getLocaleString(21910)	Bah! Is that all of them?
 getLocaleString(21911)	What I kill stays dead.
 getLocaleString(21912)	Your time is past, Blood Raven.
 getLocaleString(21913)	How has this tree escaped corruption?
 getLocaleString(21914)	This dead tree teems with energy.
 getLocaleString(21915)	These stones hold an ancient power.
 getLocaleString(21916)	Such stones are common back home.
 getLocaleString(21917)	Tristram... The first to fall to Diablo's wrath.
 getLocaleString(21918)	Ruins... the fate of all cities.
 getLocaleString(21919)	Cain! Go to the Rogue camp.
 getLocaleString(21920)	Deckard Cain, leave this place!
 getLocaleString(21921)	A Malus! This should go to Charsi.
 getLocaleString(21922)	Charsi will be thankful to get this Malus.
 getLocaleString(21923)	So much treasure almost covers the stench.
 getLocaleString(21924)	This tower has its charms...
 getLocaleString(21925)	Death becomes you, Andariel.
 getLocaleString(21926)	Your reign is over, Andariel.
 getLocaleString(21927)	Why must evil hide in such wretched places?
 getLocaleString(21928)	Face the light or lurk in darkness.
 getLocaleString(21929)	Vengeance... for Atma.
 getLocaleString(21930)	Return to dust, Radament.
 getLocaleString(21931)	An eclipse... never a good omen.
 getLocaleString(21932)	Strange... an unexpected eclipse.
 getLocaleString(21933)	Dark magic in a darker tomb...
 getLocaleString(21934)	Snakes... I hate snakes.
 getLocaleString(21935)	Serpents! I expected worse.
 getLocaleString(21936)	The sun warms the world once more.
 getLocaleString(21937)	The Sanctuary - Horazon's obsession.
 getLocaleString(21938)	This was not designed by nature's Architect.
 getLocaleString(21939)	Summoner, the dark magics have corrupted you.
 getLocaleString(21940)	This place would drive anyone mad.
 getLocaleString(21941)	Horazon. Your decoy is dead.
 getLocaleString(21942)	Now I can leave this twisted nightmare.
 getLocaleString(21943)	The Horadrim have left their mark here.
 getLocaleString(21944)	These Horadric markings are mysterious.
 getLocaleString(21945)	I can sense Tal Rasha's presence now.
 getLocaleString(21946)	So, Tal Rasha... This is your resting place.
 getLocaleString(21947)	I shall track the Prime Evils to the ends of the world.
 getLocaleString(21948)	Diablo... I will find you yet.
 getLocaleString(21949)	Black books make for dark thoughts.
 getLocaleString(21950)	An ancient manuscript...  This could be useful.
 getLocaleString(21951)	One can't judge a book by its cover.
 getLocaleString(21952)	Ormus... You have strange taste in books.
 getLocaleString(21953)	Ormus... study the book well.
 getLocaleString(21954)	And I thought the Forgotten Tower stank.
 getLocaleString(21955)	This smells worse than the sewers of Lut Gohlein.
 getLocaleString(21956)	Levers are made to be pulled.
 getLocaleString(21957)	Finally... The drain lever.
 getLocaleString(21958)	This is one drain I don't mind cleaning out.
 getLocaleString(21959)	From trash to treasure...
 getLocaleString(21960)	What a delicious blade! I should consult Ormus.
 getLocaleString(21961)	Ormus may know something about this unusual blade.
 getLocaleString(21962)	Hmm, a jade statue. What should I do with it?
 getLocaleString(21963)	It looks like jade. Perhaps it's worth something.
 getLocaleString(21964)	I dread this place of darkness.
 getLocaleString(21965)	This temple is a nest of evil.
 getLocaleString(21966)	The dark magic here is dispelled.
 getLocaleString(21967)	There is hope once again.
 getLocaleString(21968)	Mephisto... I'm coming for you.
 getLocaleString(21969)	Hatred stirs within me.
 getLocaleString(21970)	Mephisto, you were no match for me.
 getLocaleString(21971)	Mephisto's hatred was a poisonous void.
 getLocaleString(21972)	Goodbye, Izual.
 getLocaleString(21973)	Corruption... take flight.
 getLocaleString(21974)	I have no pity for him. Oblivion is his reward.
 getLocaleString(21975)	Terror stalks Hell no more.
 getLocaleString(21976)	Eternal suffering would be too brief for you, Diablo.
 getLocaleString(21977)	Lord Diablo I have bested you.
 getLocaleString(21978)	Let Diablo's death end the reign of the Three!
 getLocaleString(21979)	The reign of Terror has ended.
 getLocaleString(21980)	A hero's mistake is finally corrected.
 getLocaleString(21981)	Thus ends the plague of Terror.
 getLocaleString(21982)	My magic will break the siege.
 getLocaleString(21983)	The time has come to cleanse my homeland!
 getLocaleString(21984)	It takes more than a siege to stop me.
 getLocaleString(21985)	Baal. I'm coming for you.
 getLocaleString(21986)	The siege must be stopped.
 getLocaleString(21987)	You'll pay for your atrocities, Baal.
 getLocaleString(21988)	Baal! Nothing will stand in my way.
 getLocaleString(21989)	Harrogath can rest easier now.
 getLocaleString(21990)	The siege is broken.
 getLocaleString(21991)	My, my, what a messy little demon.
 getLocaleString(21992)	Harrogath is free of your kind, demon.
 getLocaleString(21993)	Oops...Did I do that?
 getLocaleString(21994)	Shenk, your command has ended.
 getLocaleString(21995)	The catapults have been silenced.
 getLocaleString(21996)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(21997)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(21998)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(21999)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(22000)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(22001)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(22002)	Follow me.
 getLocaleString(22003)	Could this be a trap?
 getLocaleString(22004)	A coward's hiding place.
 getLocaleString(22005)	Ahh, the familiar scent of death.
 getLocaleString(22006)	By the Light! What is this place?
 getLocaleString(22007)	...Nihlathak's home away from home.
 getLocaleString(22008)	I should have known...
 getLocaleString(22009)	Nihlathak... you can't hide from me.
 getLocaleString(22010)	Your power was no match for mine.
 getLocaleString(22011)	A fitting death for a traitor.
 getLocaleString(22012)	You were a sad little man, Nihlathak.
 getLocaleString(22013)	Nihlathak. What led you to this end?
 getLocaleString(22014)	Conspiring with Baal... What a tragic mistake.
 getLocaleString(22015)	You Dark Mages are all alike - obsessed with power.
 getLocaleString(22016)	Betrayer, you've reaped your reward.
 getLocaleString(22017)	The fabled home of the Ancients.
 getLocaleString(22018)	The guardians of Mount Arreat await.
 getLocaleString(22019)	The resting place of the Ancients...

 getLocaleString(22021)	The fabled home of the Ancients.
 getLocaleString(22022)	I shall prove worthy.
 getLocaleString(22023)	At last...The summit of Mount Arreat.
 getLocaleString(22024)	The power of the Worldstone washes over me.
 getLocaleString(22025)	The halls of the Ancients... Magnificent.
 getLocaleString(22026)	So, this is what the Ancients guard.
 getLocaleString(22027)	The Worldstone! Praise the Light.
 getLocaleString(22028)	The Worldstone!
 getLocaleString(22029)	The Worldstone. What power.
 getLocaleString(22030)	The legendary Worldstone - guardian of the Natural realm.
 getLocaleString(22031)	The last of the Three has fallen.
 getLocaleString(22032)	The Prime Evils are no more.
